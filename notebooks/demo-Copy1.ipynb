Section 601fj provides:  (1) despite anything in this division, the company named in asics record of registration as the responsible entity or temporary responsible entity of a registered scheme remains the schemes responsible entity until the record is altered to name another company as the schemes responsible entity or temporary responsible entity.. Part 5c.2 of the act deals with the re.. There is a serious question to be tried in the queensland registry proceeding whether or not the resolutions were validly passed and effective.. Section 601fn provides that asic or a member of a registered scheme may apply to the court for the appointment of a temporary re if the scheme does not have an re that meets the requirements of s 601fa.\n",
