      "A yearlong study by the Community Service Society of New York has concluded that the problem of homeless people on the streets of the city has ''reached such extraordinary proportions'' that emergency housing must be set up.   The study, to be made public tomorrow, says government agencies have failed to face the problem of the homeless and have made it even worse with the state's program of discharging many patients from mental institutions into communities.   The homeless are found in almost every part of the city. Sometimes they are seen shuffling along the streets or crouched in doorways seeking temporary shelter from wind and rain. They inhabit the bus and railroad stations and subways until they are chased away by the police.\n",

''there are some people who choose not to come to the shelters,'' he said.
