The benefits of digital disruption to customers are all around us. Artificial intelligence. Google estimates that all human data from pre-history to 2003 was roughly 5 exabytes. The transformation of road transport may also involve a revolution in how vehicles are used and owned. Smarter healthcare. Blockchain. Chain reaction. We see blockchain’s characteristics as adaptable to multiple uses across the economy and society. While the potential benefits of blockchain are diverse, they are likely to take time to be realized.

Citi research sees few signs that this technology is going to have a material impact on public companies’ earnings in the near term. Quicker, cheaper, and more accurate diagnosis could improve and save lives, as well as limiting rising healthcare costs. All users can store their own copy of the database and all are required to validate new information added to it. Another is that even if blockchain based systems do emerge, they do not interact effectively, thus replicating today’s fragmentation\n",
