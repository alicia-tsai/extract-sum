And the lord said unto moses, depart, [and] go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt, unto the land which i sware unto abraham, to isaac, and to jacob, saying, unto thy seed will i give it: and i will send an angel before thee; and i will drive out the canaanite, the amorite, and the hittite, and the perizzite, the hivite, and the jebusite: unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for i will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou [art] a stiffnecked people: lest i consume thee in the way\n",
