      "The Registrar must be satisfied that either of the following is the case:   (a) the application has been certified under Part 11 by each representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body that could certify the application in performing its functions under that Part; or   (b) the applicant is a member of the native title claim group and is authorised to make the application, and deal with matters arising in relation to it, by all the other persons in the native title claim group..\n",

      "It was explained that:   certificate is provided by [NQLC] in respect of amended native title determination application QUD158/2004 filed in the Federal Court by [the persons making up the applicant]..\n",
      "The NQLC then certified that it was of the opinion that the requirements of paragraphs of 203BE (2)(a) and (b) of the Act had been met and in particular that:     all the persons in the Native Title claim group have authorised the applicant to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it; and   (b) all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the Application describes or otherwise identifies all the other persons in the native title claim group..\n",
      "In answer to the requirement:   The members of the Native Title claim group must be (a) named or (b) described so that they can be readily identified (section 190B(3))   it was said that the relevant part of the Form 1 application, Sch A/Attachment A  does not satisfy the test  and the comment was made that  the delegate would refer you to the detailed reasons given when the matter was last tested in April 2005 ..\n",
      "In both those matters the claim group had been described by reference to the list of persons from whom the Wakaman people were said to be descended and the known apical ancestors of the Wakaman People, the delegate observed..\n",

      "The applicant also submitted that the delegate was in error in finding that the native title claim group described in the third application was a wider, and significantly different, group from that referred to in the previous application, which had been subject of certification..\n",
      "It was to be noted, his Honour observed, that s 203B(2) emphatically states that the representative body  must not  provide its certificate unless it is of the opinion that all persons in the claim group have authorised the applicant to make the application..\n",
