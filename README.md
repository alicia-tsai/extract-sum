### Outlook example
```
the first is a return to pre-crisis normalcy in the global monetary system and markets.

1, assess your portfolio now.

but the withdrawal of monetary stimulus - as well as rate rises in the us - clearly left markets more vulnerable to the political shock of the escalating international trade war in particular.

as longer-term investors, we continue watching trade developments, as well as chinese and asian economic performance, and comparing them to market data to determine whether or not it is an appropriate time to add or reduce exposure.

2, understand your risk profile.

faced with the return of market normalcy on the one hand and its retreat politically, how should you invest in 2019? the approach we take in outlook 2019 has two main elements.

if you have a five- to ten-year investment horizon, you probably don't need to change it.

voters in countries including the us, the uk, the philippines, italy, hungary, and brazil have given their backing over recent years to political movements fronted by populist strongmen whose agendas are characterized by foreign policy isolationism, economic nationalism, closed borders, and perhaps also authoritarian law-and-order policies.

you can help preserve the safety and return potential of your portfolio this way.

the second is the uncomfortable new normal in politics and international relations.
