"What should I do with my portfolio for 2019? A decade or so after the global economic
recovery began and following a more difficult year in the markets in 2018, that’s the one question you ask us more than any other. We stand ready to discuss how you might implement these and other steps in your portfolio. I look forward to speaking with you in person, either at one of our Outlook 2019 events or thereafter.",How to invest in 2019,"We believe the answer lies in reconciling two very different and powerful developments in the world. The first is a return to pre-crisis normalcy in the global monetary system and markets. The second is the uncomfortable new normal in politics and international relations. The return to normalcy in the global monetary system and markets concerns central banks’ bringing to an end their emergency measures to prevent the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 becoming a new Great Depression. Central banks are gradually retreating from zero borrowing costs and their multi-trillion dollar asset purchases that had fueled markets. The withdrawal of these measures has seen market volatility rise, unsettling many investors who had become accustomed to the placid conditions of recent years. Against this backdrop, 2018 was different to 2017 for investors. Global equities were down 4.3% for the year as of 1 December, compared to their 20.0% gain the prior year. Emerging markets fell 14.1%, after their 34.4% rally in 2017. This pullback may have been partly a reaction to the strong gains that preceded it. But the withdrawal of monetary stimulus - as well as rate rises in the US - clearly left markets more vulnerable to the political shock of the escalating international trade war in particular. Asset prices thus suffered greater volatility than they had done for several years. The return to normalcy has not felt as good as investors may have expected. In politics and geopolitics, by contrast, normalcy is in retreat. The post-Cold War international order – characterized by multilateral cooperation, freer movement of people, and more tolerant societies – is under pressure. Voters in countries including the US, the UK, The Philippines, Italy, Hungary, and Brazil have given their backing over recent years to political movements fronted by populist strongmen whose agendas are characterized by foreign policy isolationism, economic nationalism, closed borders, and perhaps also authoritarian law-and-order policies. The populist strongmen have skillfully played upon voters’ fears and insecurities. Income stagnation, growing wealth inequality, official corruption, and intellectual property theft do indeed present genuine challenges in many countries. But the strongmen have been quicker to decry the problems than to propose genuine answers. Anti-immigrant rhetoric has intensified, while immigrants’ social and economic contribution has been ignored. Greater security has been offered in return for sacrificing some personal liberties. In certain countries, a restoration of national greatness has been promised, with the details of implementation to be filled in later. We do not see this new and uncomfortable political normalcy reversing any time soon. Certain leaders will continue to seek to bolster their powers, sweeping aside many checks and balances. President Xi has already abolished limits on his time in office in China, while Brazil’s new president Bolsonaro has praised the country’s former dictatorship. Any weakening of global economic growth could further strengthen nationalist sentiment, the appetite for trade tariffs, and calls to vest even greater power in the hands of these politicians. Faced with the return of market normalcy on the one hand and its retreat politically, how should you invest in 2019? The approach we take in Outlook 2019 has two main elements. First, we create guideposts to determine how we may anticipate events, and assess their potential impact on your portfolio. Second, we advise building stronger portfolios for turbulent times by investing in more resilient assets and by employing strategies that reshape investment outcomes. By watching the guideposts, you can then make portfolio adjustments going forward, seeking additional diversification, and tactically exploiting valuation opportunities as they arise.Among our key guideposts for 2019 is the state of global trade. The escalation of trade tensions in 2018 took many investors by surprise, triggering volatility in markets in China and other emerging economies in particular. As longer-term investors, we continue watching trade developments, as well as Chinese and Asian economic performance, and comparing them to market data to determine whether or not it is an appropriate time to add or reduce exposure. As well as trade, we believe investors should focus upon the likely impact of the Fed’s gradual, but extended tightening cycle. Besides watching our guideposts, we also emphasize taking positive action now. The return of monetary and market normalcy – and the new normalcy in politics – make portfolio quality even more important. We therefore urge you to allocate to countries and companies that are most likely to withstand the challenges now facing the world. We also advocate seeking to augment your total return profile and help mitigate your risks. Here are nine steps that we recommend you consider to strengthen portfolios as we enter 2019. 1, Assess your portfolio now. Request your Outlook Watchlist, and discuss the opportunities with your Investment Counselor. Seek the insights of our Global Investment Lab where you have specialized queries. 2, Understand your risk profile. If you have a five- to ten-year investment horizon, you probably don’t need to change it. But if your circumstances or risk tolerance has changed, your portfolio should be updated accordingly. 3, Don’t try and time the financial markets – it’s a fool’s game. 4, Preserve your portfolio’s value by diversifying globally and adding higher quality assets. Global investors will be able to ride out turbulence better and may potentially recover faster. 5, Have a discretionary manager rebalance your portfolio as events unfold. By doing so quarterly or at least semi-annually, your portfolio should add assets when markets are cheaper and tilt towards markets likely to recover faster. As markets rally, such portfolios are likely to garner better risk-adjusted returns. 6, Manage your cash – all of it – more wisely. 7, Explore risk management tools as well as strategies with different risk-return characteristics. You can help preserve the safety and return potential of your portfolio this way. 8, Create an opportunistic element within your portfolio to allow you to invest during unusual events and short-term market dislocations. 9, Seek our advice more frequently, and let us help you understand the data, and interpret the guideposts."
"In today’s late-cycle US monetary tightening phase, we recommend a variety of actions to prepare portfolios for the coming year and beyond. Staying positive, but building up our defenses. Regular portfolio rebalancing is essential for 2019 and beyond. What central bank policy tightening means for portfolios. A second headwind. Buying value is better than chasing momentum. Managing late-cycle risks. A time to hedge. It is the right time to take portfolio actions.",Building stronger portfolios for turbulent times,"Global investors have routinely doubted the durability of the economic expansion that began in 2009. However, their doubts have been repeatedly contradicted by the breadth and persistence of the recovery. By the second half 2019, we believe the US expansion will likely have become the longest since records began in 1854.That means we need to understand what allowed the expansion to continue so long, what will likely bring it to an end, and what investors should do to make their portfolios resilient. We do not recommend that investors attempt to time markets in their core portfolios. We do recommend investors add quality and rotate from more expensive markets into better value ones. The US expansion to date has not seen the same sort of excesses in consumer demand and indebtedness that occurred around past peaks. This is good – but also somewhat remarkable - given the late-stage stimulus delivered by tax cuts in 2018. Although US inflation is rising, it remains low for the later stages of a long expansion. Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve is tightening monetary policy more gradually than usual – figure 1. Whereas more aggressive tightening in past cycles has choked off expansions prematurely, this recovery has not faced this constraint. We expect the global expansion to continue over the coming year, despite various risks from politics and international relations, in particular. We also see the outlook for asset prices as positive, with the potential for ongoing modest returns in global equities and fixed income by the end of 2019 – figures 2 and 3. With a handful of idiosyncratic exceptions around the world – see Portfolio perspectives – the economic expansion outside the US should provide a tailwind to world economic growth. Recent market turbulence - such as we saw in early October 2018 - has done nothing to change our positive conviction that global companies can increase their profits in 2019. Investors were clearly unsettled by the US 10-year Treasury yield rising above 3% for the first time since late 2013. This came on top of ongoing concerns over global trade – see Will the trade war open or close markets? We see what really happens with global trade as a key guidepost for the markets for the coming year and beyond. If there is clarity on trade between China and the US, it would refocus investors on the positive economic conditions enjoyed by many countries. Greater clarity seems likelier following the successful summit meeting between President Trump and President Xi on 1 December 2018. A further critical guidepost is from US monetary policy, by way of movements in the yield curve. Tightening is led principally by the Fed, with central banks elsewhere eventually following. The speed and degree of such actions needs to be followed closely.OUTLOOK 2019CITI PRIVATE BANKRegular portfolio rebalancing is essential for 2019 and beyondPersistent global growth in the face of heavy bouts of market anxiety on the one hand and monetary policy tightening on the other are contradictory forces that will ultimately moderate return prospects for 2019. While the Federal Reserve has recently refocused on the need for its policy to react to positive or negative economic outcomes, we still recommend a clear focus on portfolio quality and a more conservative asset allocation at this stage of the market cycle. We remain slightly overweight global equities – figure4– but with gradually increasing allocations to defensive fixed income strategies, relative to one year ago. Over time, we are likely to continue reducing our cyclical exposure, in anticipation of the increasing impact of the Fed’s tightening. What central bank policy tightening means for portfoliosUnlike in the early years of the present expansion, investors can no longer expect a favorable confluence of strong economic growth and easy monetary conditions. Assuming a lack of negative economic shocks next year, the Fed might hike rates as many as four more times in the twelve months from December 2018. Many investors never believed the Fed would get this far. Indeed, markets currently doubt the Fed will see its stated schedule of hikes through. However, investors should be mindful that there have already been eight rate increases of 25 basis points. The Fed may do significantly less, as markets now expect. However, under the most positive US growth scenarios, the rate hike tally could conceivably reach twelve or thirteen by the end of 2019.OverviewFed interest rate hikes have typically been an indicator of favorable conditions. As the economy strengthens, corporate profits rise, markets rally, and the Fed tightens in response to this strength. Early cycle tightening periods are thus positive for investors – figure5. The Fed then gradually raises its risk-free rate towards or above the US nominal economic growth rate. As the expansion ages, and parts of the economy overheat, underlying risks progressively build – see What to expect when you are expecting recession below. Subsequently, the early stages of Fed easing cycles are generally bearish for investors. Business cycle activity is depressed, and the Fed is typically lagging behind in delivering the rate cuts necessary to stimulate recovery. That said, the fact that the US is raising rates means it will ultimately have the monetary firepower to re-energize the economy when conditions call for it. A second headwindNot only is the Fed raising rates, but it also plans to shrink its balance sheet by roughly $700 billion by not reinvesting the proceeds of its bond holdings as they mature. Other central banks will not be stepping in to offset the resulting loss of stimulus. This makes a slowdown more likely. That is because as rates rise and as the central bank lends less with its own balance sheet, government borrowing in many countries will crowd out the private sector for savings. Their increased demand for funds will gradually affect returns across all asset classes, continuing the trend begun in 2018. Given these facts and assuming we avoid negative shocks to the global economy, it is possible that the US 10-year Treasury yield could rise to as high as 3.75% in 2019.OUTLOOK 2019CITI PRIVATE BANKBuying value is better than chasing momentumWith the US at a later stage of its economic cycle than the rest of the world, US earnings per share (EPS) are 55% above their 2007 peak. By contrast, non-US EPS remain 20% below their last peak. As well as a stronger recovery in earnings, US equity valuations have risen more sharply. Investors pay about one-quarter more for a dollar of US earnings than they do for non-US earnings. But should they do so now?For much of the time in recent years, buying the more highly valued US has been rewarded with outperformance. However, we do not advocate persisting with this approach. In a late-cycle environment, we are mindful of the risk of ‘buying high.’ The history of markets suggests that the good recent performance in one asset class is unlikely to repeat itself. Over the last decade, the best performing of the ten asset classes shown in the infographic in Safeguarding assets has been US small- and mid-cap equities. Currently, they trade on 24 times trailing earnings. Most of these smaller firms have weaker balance sheets to weather future economic storms, with greater debt burdens. We currently have a slightly underweight tactical allocation to US small- and mid- caps, even while acknowledging that the segment may rebound in coming months. We are likely to deepen our underweight as future risks build, underscoring our view that small caps are unlikely to be the next decade’s top performer – see Wise idea: Sell booms, buy busts.Managing late-cycle risksDespite our conviction that there is meaningful upside for risk assets heading into 2019, we also recognize investors’ desire to preserve prior years’ gains. We therefore want investors to consider ways of maintaining market exposure while protecting against downside - see Safeguarding assets. We also advocate exploring hedging possibilities. The cost of hedging against a cyclical bear market – a temporary drawdown of 20% or more in US equities – is priced at 63%1 lower for the next two years than it was during the first two years of the present economic recovery. At that stage, the US economy was deeply depressed. Equity valuations were half their current level. It seems anomalous to us that a cyclical bear market is priced as Overviewbeing less probable after a decade of growth and rising markets than it was after just two years of the same. We see the low cost of hedging now as an anomaly and a potential opportunity. We believe hedging offers a potential alternative to attempts to time the market aggressively – see This is not the time to time the markets.A time to hedgeHedging has shown benefits when measured over full cycles – figure 6. However, it seems likelier to add value after a long bull market than at times when asset prices and economic activity are deeply depressed. We thus recommend hedging at times like these. While the macro-level illustrations are useful, we suggest doing so in a cost-effective way that does not require frequent and expensive adjustments. It is the right time to take portfolio actions...Hedging is just one of our recommended actions as we enter 2019. In this publication, we explore a variety of opportunities that may help to prepare portfolios for the coming year and beyond. As well as our tactical positioning for the period immediately ahead, we also consider the multi-year prospects for asset classes – see The long-term outlook for asset classes– as well as our investment themes. By combining our recommended actions, we believe you can build stronger portfolios for more turbulent times. We believe you should do so now."
We do not expect the next US recession and global downturn to begin in 2019. What is a normal recession like? Investors tend to overreact. Not yet.,2020: What to expect when you are expecting recession,"We do not expect the next US recession and global downturn to begin in 2019. Time-tested leading indicators of economic activity are not currently consistent with a contraction in the next twelve months. However, financial markets are among these leading indicators, and fears of a 2020 peak may become more prevalent before 2019 is over. And there is always a risk that unanticipated shocks may accelerate the onset of recession. Therefore, we think it is worth thinking about what the next recession may look and feel like.We do not believe the next recession will resemble the last one. The 2008-09 slump was deep, as those associated with financial crises have usually been. Today, the banking system is better capitalized than it was ahead of the last crisis, with tangible common equity having doubled since 2007. We believe both the next recession and associated bear market will be on a lesser scale than those of a decade ago. The probability of a recession rises in 2020. With demand for labor gradually set to outstrip supply, overheating risks may come to the fore. While the US financial sector may enter the next downturn with a stronger balance sheet than it did last time round, the same cannot be said of the US government. President Trump’s policy experiment of seeking to boost growth sharply in the later stages of a cycle via tax cuts and spending increases has seen an already large budget deficit of $604bn in 2017 swell to $804bn in 2018. The Congressional Budget Office sees further widening of the deficit in each year out to 2026. Such deficits reduce market liquidity as funding requirements rise and consumer savings fall.What is a normal recession like? Investors tend to overreact.Once a downturn does strike, investors should keep events and their portfolios in perspective. Post-war recessions – including the Global Financial Crisis – have involved an average of slightly less than one year of contracting economic activity, and one year of sharply negative equity returns. Over time, though, investors have tended to behave as if such periods might be almost permanent, and have committed asset allocation errors whose negative effects persist for years. How do you know when a recession becomes more likely? Asfigure7 shows, an inverted US yield curve has preceded every US downturn for the past half century. There have been a couple false or early warnings, but no contraction cycles have occurred without this signal being triggered. US contractions have begun on average twelve months after long yields have fallen below the Fed’s policy rate. US equities – also a leading indicator, but with a shorter lead time – have peaked on average four months after yield curve inversions. Of course, there are no guarantees when assessing financial market performance. However, we note the past tendency of credit markets and equities to have been much more coincident indicators of economic downturns than the yield curve – figure 8.Not yet!Despite widespread attention and concern, the US yield curve has yet to invert and thus start some of our recession ‘clocks’ ticking. While we have already de-risked our asset allocation over the past year, we believe the sharp valuation declines driven by rising EPS and investor pessimism are premature. In the coming year, we will further describe our guideposts for the eventual recession, and recommend more steps to prepare portfolios. "
"In September 2018, the US successfully concluded a revised trade agreement with South Korea, and then with Canada and Mexico. Two different outcomes, one benign and one dangerous",Will the trade war open or close markets?,"In September 2018, the US successfully concluded a revised trade agreement with South Korea, and then with Canada and Mexico. During 2018, hopes and fears over trade between the European Union and the US waxed and waned. For China, the US announced escalating tariff rates for 2019, but subsequently said it would hold off amid negotiations for a wide-ranging trade deal by the end of February. Will the US-driven renegotiations and other actions result in more open or more closed international trade?The US administration appears to have two conflicting objectives in the trade war that it has initiated. One is ‘freer trade’ (FT) - a reduction of global trade barriers. The other is what might be called ‘better trade’ (BT), which seeks to erase US trade deficits by erecting strategic trade barriers, and by bringing more of the manufacturing supply chain back onshore to the US. We see both of these objectives represented by current and former White House officials. Former White House economic advisor Gary Cohn was the best known voice for FT, with Director of the National Trade Council Peter Navarro the most visible proponent of BT. Markets have long held out the hope that FT would predominate, that trade barriers would actually come down, and the trade war would have no casualties.It has not always been clear which of these two objectives President Trump supports. Despite cutting trade deals with certain partners that have reduced trade barriers, some of his comments suggest traditional protectionism is his ultimate goal. Indeed, it seems to be the case that the US is aiming both to lower and raise trade barriers for specific counterparties – see The expected and unexpected events of 2018.Two different outcomes, one benign and one dangerousA conventional economic analysis of the objectives of FT and BT finds sharply different economic implications. The goal of FT aligns closely with mainstream economic theory. It suggests that a victory would boost global economic activity and, by extension, financial markets. In contrast, the goal of BT is best viewed as a zero-sum game or worse. The US economy has added 12 million jobs since the economic peak of 2007. As figure9 shows, the nation has seen unemployment drop to less than 4% in recent years ‘despite’ its large trade deficit. In fact, faster US growth and budget deficits – which create demand not supply – quite ordinarily cause a rise in demand for imports. The US cannot produce all it consumes any more than individual workers could fashion their own vehicles to drive to work. Both require trade with others at a macro and micro level. Satisfying US internal demand without any external supplies would most likely mean higher prices and a lower output level for the US and almost any other economy. There are signs and statements supporting the idea that the President has feet in both camps. While deals struck with key allies in North America and Asia suggest a willingness to engage in FT, his other statements suggest a risk he leans more towards BT. These include his oft-repeated assertion that it is easy to win a trade war with another country when you have a $100bn deficit ‘by just not trading’. As a result, we must be mindful of how the negotiations with China go in coming months, with implications for Europe in particular. On the one hand, freer trade could calm tensions and extend the current period of global growth. On the other, we may see a greater negative impact as trade slows globally. Given these scenarios, our view is that investors should prepare portfolios for either outcome. "
"The trade war came as a shock to markets in 2018, alongside the strong growth and monetary tightening that we expected. We consider the implications for investors looking ahead. We consider trade to be critical to the outlook for how corporate profits might perform. New world disorder. In the coming year, the US and China may also clash over currency policy. Ire over Iran.",The expected and unexpected events of 2018,"The trade war came as a shock to markets in 2018, alongside the strong growth and monetary tightening that we expected. We consider the implications for investors looking ahead. In 2018, financial market returns were shaped by three major influences. We had expected two of them, but underestimated the likelihood and impact of the third. First, we expected strong economic and corporate profit growth. Full year average US GDP growth is estimated at around 3% for 2018, with global growth of about 3.3%. US earnings per share (EPS) are on track for a gain of roughly 23%, and global EPS for some 17%.1 We estimate roughly 8 percentage points of the 2018 US profit gain derives from a one-time cut in corporate tax rates. Still, the overall robustness of profits, particularly for the US, has been better than we expected. Second, we anticipated the US Federal Reserve’s reduction in its asset holdings and higher borrowing by the US Treasury would syphon flows away from other asset classes. Steven Wieting  Chief Investment Strategist and Chief EconomistThe trade war came as a shock to markets in 2018, alongside the strong growth and monetary tightening that we expected. We consider the implications for investors looking ahead. In turn, we thought this would mean more limited returns for most financial markets than in 2017. This too came to pass. Valuations in global equities and fixed income have fallen, but returns have been positive overall. Returns over the past twelve months have been about 3.1% for US equities and -7.9% for non-US equities, as of 23 November 2018. For a global benchmark of equities and fixed income together, the return in US dollar terms has been about 0.1%. The Fed’s asset holdings have fallen by $230 billion in 2018 to date. At the same time, due to higher deficits from the tax cut, borrowing by the US Treasury has increased by $100 billion relative to 2017. Increased government borrowing from the private sector is one of many factors that drove US yields up in 2018, pressuring fixed income and equity returns worldwide. Thirdly, while we noted in Outlook 2018that disruptions to world trade represented the biggest risk to global growth, we did not expect the trade war to unfold as it did – figure 1. The anticipated disruption of global trade – in combination with Fed tightening and some idiosyncratic country issues – caused sharp divergence between US and non-US asset market performance during the year. In some cases, this involved already undervalued assets declining and already richly valued ones rising further.New world disorderBoth tax cuts and trade protectionism were among Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign promises in 2016. However, trade protectionism got sidelined by US domestic political negotiations in 2017, before coming to the fore. The desire of all countries involved to strike quick trade deals with the US or risk worse actual or threatened tariffs is not easy to judge. Trade policy uncertainty was the single biggest reason why we reduced our overall non-US equities weightings in July 2018. Importantly, we consider trade to be critical to the outlook for how corporate profits might perform, including for US firms, whose vulnerability may be underappreciated by investors. We consider trade to be critical to the outlook for how corporate profits might perform. Successfully completed trade agreements with Mexico and Canada will likely further convince President Trump of the effectiveness of his aggressive, tariff-led approach. However, those two nations have by far the greatest reliance on US trade, and are threatened directly by diminished economic activity with the US. The lengthy battles to achieve these new North American trade deals highlight just how difficult it may be to reach further agreements with the European Union and China, despite hopeful statements from all sides.In May 2018, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announced that the US was ‘putting the trade war on hold’ following negotiations with Chinese counterparts. The initial optimism that his statement created was quickly dashed. Since then, it has seemed that the US’s ideal outcome would be a complete overhaul of China’s approach to subsidizing industry, the opening of the country’s domestic markets to foreign competition, and a hard quantitative reduction in China’s trade surplus with the US. The US would also like greater protection of intellectual property, a goal widely shared by others. While these goals might seem advantageous, the US has offered nothing in return save lifting its punishing tariffs.Following failed attempts to strike an early deal, the US subsequently announced large-scale tariffs on Chinese imports with pre-set escalation. The Chinese authorities compared the situation to the bitter Opium Wars of the nineteenth century, in which the British Empire forced China to legalize the opium trade, open its markets to British merchants, and lift import taxes. Memories of the accompanying ‘century of humiliation’ – the loss of economic control and territory to foreigners – remain sensitive in modern China.All this naturally presents a host of geopolitical and economic hazards for the world. However, on 1 December, Presidents Trump and Xi separately announced a ‘highly successful’ agreement to negotiate a trade truce. The US’s has set a deadline for its conclusion in late February, and expects it to be followed by large-scale Chinese purchases of US agricultural products and industrial supplies, a variety of measures to protect intellectual property, and for US firms to be given better access to Chinese markets. While the agreement is clearly a positive development, suspense will continue right up until the deadline. Also, the trade talks cannot be expected to end all friction between the two powers.After decades of global economic integration, a disintegration of ties between the world’s two largest national economies raises risks to both business and portfolios – figure 2. Companies and investors underappreciate many potential outcomes including the possibility that citizens of certain domiciles will not be as free to invest as they are now. Another is the risk that services, currently not on the negotiating table, will become a target for China, widening the trade war’s scope, and hurting US businesses more directly. In a potential silver lining that is merely theoretical for now, a reversal of the integration between the Chinese and US economies could bring about lower correlations between asset prices over time, and thus greater potential portfolio diversification benefits. In the coming year, the US and China may also clash over currency policy. Ire over IranThe US trade dispute with China is not the only pressing issue for the coming year. In pulling the US out the 2015 nuclear non-proliferation deal with Iran, President Trump stated that ‘anyone doing business with Iran will not be doing business with the US.’ The US subsequently took action to exclude firms found engaged in commerce with Iran from using the US banking system, from settling trade in US dollars, and from engaging in commerce in the US. Quite unpredictably, it also exempted eight of Iran’s major oil customers from the same sanctions, causing convulsions in the global oil price.By contrast, the European Union said it would not abandon the 2015 accord. In an unprecedented step, it said it would create a special payments channel open to all countries that would facilitate what it recognizes as legal trade with Iran. Whether or not this special purpose vehicle can successfully hide and shield economic actors from US sanctions, the opposing stances of two longtime allies over Iran suggests a great loss of policy cohesion between the US and Europe. The US has elsewhere openly stated that a multi-lateral approach weakens outcomes for the US. For a second year at the United Nations, Trump argued against accepting a consensual approach that fails to put US interests first. As long-term wealth and risk managers, we have to be concerned over whether the value of strategic alliances will some day be tested again, as in so many great tragedies of history. As international cohesion weakens and diplomatic relations become less predictable, we reiterate the importance of global diversification. Having exposure to multiple asset classes across the world may help to mitigate the effect of local or regional flare-ups. While the world as a whole is likely to be worse off as a result of greater barriers to trade, certain countries may be less affected than others, while some may gain at others’ expense. We also highlight the possibility of making opportunistic investments if short-term overreactions to flare-ups create divergences between price and value. Even if trade and geopolitics become less global, your portfolio should certainly not."
Investing more in cheap asset classes and less in expensive ones can help improve risk-adjusted returns over time. But doing so requires a disciplined approach. A better way via AVS. Understanding return expectations. Buying undervalued markets and reducing exposure to expensive ones has proven incrementally profitable – provided the portfolio remains fully invested.,Wise idea: Selling booms and buying busts,"Investing more in cheap asset classes and less in expensive ones can help improve risk-adjusted returns over time. But doing so requires a disciplined approach.Late-cycle investing presents a unique challenge. After sustained growth periods, profits have accumulated and future investor expectations follow animal spirits, running wild. Many investors herd into markets and asset classes that have already performed well, paying high valuations in the hope of further gains. Later on, amidst the despair of a final-stage bust, investors all too easily capitulate not long before markets begin to rebound strongly. These poor investor behaviors reflect, in the first case, the fear of missing out and, in the second case, loss aversion. In both cases, the poor behaviors can have significant effects on wealth. The seemingly logical answer here may be to adopt Warren Buffett’s approach of selling booms and buying busts. Some investors try to do this by switching aggressively between risky assets and cash at perceived times of boom and bust. Such random market timing efforts almost inevitably limit portfolio returns and increase portfolio volatility – see This is not the time for market timing. A better way via AVSInvestors do not need to shift allocations based on perceptions, however. Citi Private Bank’s strategic asset allocation methodology – Adaptive Valuation Strategies (AVS) – has an inherent tendency to sell booms and buy busts. When determining how much to allocate to each asset class, AVS focuses upon current valuations and how they compare to historical ones. In order to do so, it relies on a simple but powerful insight: low current valuations have typically preceded periods of high relative returns over time. In contrast, high valuations are indicative of future periods of comparatively low returns. AVS thus allocates more to asset classes whose low valuations point to higher future risk-adjusted returns, which is a typical feature of those markets or asset classes that have suffered a ’bust‘, a period of unusual underperformance. AVS also allocates less to asset classes whose high valuations potentially indicate lower risk-adjusted returns, something often seen after a long boom. While risk asset classes have generally risen over the last decade, some have appreciated much more than others. The US is a standout example. Driven by the US economy’s uninterrupted recovery since mid-2009, US large-cap and US small- & mid-cap equities were the decade’s two top-performing asset classes - see Safeguarding assets. The appreciation of the US dollar has further contributed sharply to US returns measured in US dollars – figure 1 – as well as pushing US equities’ share of global market capitalization to multi-year highs. Understanding return expectationsWe do not believe that US small- and mid-cap equities and US large caps will be the next decade’s top performers. Why? As our Asset class performance infographic shows - see Safeguarding assets - no asset class in our study has experienced two consecutive decades as top performer. We thus believe that these two asset classes’ current high valuations point to more typical future returns, according to AVS methodology. Sometime after 2019, we also expect the US dollar to begin weakening and continue doing so over subsequent years. This would reduce US asset values for non-dollar investors and raise returns for non-dollar assets. In our present tactical asset allocation, therefore, we have neutral weightings to both US small- and mid-cap equities, as well as to US large caps. By contrast, emerging market equities suffered something of a bust in 2018. As a result, their relatively low valuations point to annualized returns over the coming decade of 11.6% - more than double the strategic return estimate for developed market equities – see figure 1 in The long-term outlook for asset classes. AVS thus adapts its recommended allocations in light of this outlook. And our Global Investment Committee has complemented this with a further ‘tactical’ or additional overweight recommendation on our present twelve- to eighteen-month view favoring emerging equities.The case for selling booms and buying busts based upon decades of market data is compelling. Market timing is an ineffective way to enhance a portfolio’s risk-adjusted returns. In contrast, buying undervalued markets and reducing exposure to expensive ones has proven incrementally profitable – provided the portfolio remains fully invested. By aligning your portfolio to your recommended AVS allocation while reallocating its assets periodically, selling booms and buying busts automatically becomes an element within your investment strategy. Both shorter- and longer-term, this is likely to produce better risk-adjusted returns and make the trajectory of your portfolio potentially less volatile and more profitable. Allowing your assets to be managed via a disciplined discretionary   process is one way to help ensure your portfolio is routinely re-evaluated and rebalanced. That sure beats being guided by animal spirits.Buying undervalued markets and reducing exposure to expensive ones has proven incrementally profitable – provided the portfolio remains fully invested.

"Market timing in a late-stage bull market may sound like a good idea. But experience suggests that there is no ‘right time’ to time the markets. Getting in at the ’wrong‘ time. Getting in at the ’right’ time. Waiting until the ‘right’ time? Avoiding drawdowns? So let’s just avoid the worst 10 days and capture the best 10 days. I bet there is a way to do this, right? There is compelling evidence against aggressive attempts to time the markets. We see many wise and prudent steps you can take to preserve and create value. Boring but smart: get invested, stay invested, add to portfolios over time.",This is not the time for market timing,"Market timing in a late-stage bull market may sound like a good idea. But experience suggests that there is no ‘right time’ to time the markets. It sounds perfectly logical. If we can avoid the ’big drawdown’ by selling at the peak and buying back in at the trough, we will obviously make more money. So obvious does it seem, that many investors devote themselves entirely to trying to catch most of the markets’ upside and then switching into cash during downturns. However, a look at the data suggests that market timing is neither easy nor profitable. Let’s start from the bottom.Getting in at the ’wrong‘ timeHow would you have done if you’d been unfortunate enough to have invested at some of the least favorable times in recent decades? Figure 1 shows how long you’d have had to have waited to get back to breakeven had you invested one month before eight of the worst periods of market stress since 1973. These are returns from an investment in a global multi-asset class allocation equivalent to a Citi Private Bank AVS allocation at Risk Level 3, containing developed equities, investment grade fixed income, and US corporate fixed income. Investing one month prior to a crisis generates losses that take time to recover. How long? On average, it would have taken 2.8 years to recover the original investment. In the worst-case scenario, it took 4.7 years. If the investment had been entirely in developed equities – a concentrated allocation that we would not recommend – the average recovery time was 3.2 years and the longest was 6 years. Getting in at the ’right’ timeSome of the strongest positive returns have occurred in the aftermath of stress periods. Figure 2 shows the S&P 500’s performance in each of the four years following four prominent stress periods. However, evidence suggests that most investors freeze up in fear after periods of negative returns and end up sitting in cash, especially during the first of the four years. That’s precisely what keeps them from generating profits, as the largest positive returns are often clustered in that first post-stress period year. 29Waiting until the ‘right’ time?Should you invest now or wait? When we consider the long-term risk-adjusted return potential from asset allocation – see Safeguarding assets: Global portfolios are the cornerstone - it is certainly possible to do better than trying to time the markets. Different markets make profits at different times. By holding a global equity and fixed income portfolio based in large part on the relative value of each, we could generate better risk-adjusted returns than with market timing. This comes partly from asset allocation and partly from rebalancing, moving from expensive markets to cheaper ones in a fashion that most investors cannot accomplish on their own. Avoiding drawdowns?What about avoiding drawdowns once you are already invested? Figure 3 compares the annualized returns from staying fully invested in the S&P 500 over three consecutive ten-year periods. It also shows the scenarios of being invested but somehow managing to avoid the market’s ten worst days, and also missing its ten best days during those periods. From 1988 to 1997, the annualized return on an investment in the S&P 500 would have risen from 17.6% to 22.8% by avoiding the ten worst days. By contrast, missing out on the market’s ten best days would have resulted in an annualized return of 13.9%. The experience would have been even worse by missing the market’s ten best days in each of the next two decades.So let’s just avoid the worst 10 days and capture the best 10 days!Clearly, avoiding the market’s worst days would have led to much higher returns. However, it turns out that the best days and the worst days are typically clustered in the same periods. In other words, you’d have had to have been entering and exiting the market with pinpoint accuracy and high frequency. Without perfect foresight, the probability of being able to achieve this is practically zero. OUTLOOK 2019CITI PRIVATE BANKI bet there is a way to do this, right?There’s a widespread belief that market timing can be successful if rules are followed, rather than relying upon gut feelings. Many of the best known market-timing systems are based on price action looking at ’inflection points.‘ For example, some investors believe that moving average crossovers give confirmation of new uptrends and downtrends respectively. Specifically, when the 50-day moving average of a market’s price crosses above its 200-day moving average – ‘a golden cross’ – it is said to be a buy signal, and when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average – ‘a death cross’ – it is said to be a sell signal.Between January 1997 and December 2016 – figure 4 - a market timing strategy of switching in and out of the S&P 500 Index based on these crosses would have delivered an annualized total return of 6.8%. However, this was considerably less that the 7.6% a buy-and-hold strategy would have returned. Nor did market timing achieve a superior risk-adjusted return, as measured by the Sharpe ratio. In fact, systems don’t work very well. Market timing systems – however complicated they become – are prone to being out of the market at times of particular strength. The negative effects this can have on a portfolio’s compound returns over time can be painful. And the answer is...No method of market timing has been shown to be consistently better over time to having a globally diversified asset allocation. As we have seen, the best single years following stress periods have tended to be the very first year, when many market timers would have been out of the market. A leading ‘rules-based’ switching strategy produced inferior returns to buy-and-hold. And even the least fortunate of diversified buy-and-hold investors – those who invested just ahead of a stress period – would still have achieved better returns than holding cash after no more than a half a decade in the periods examined.OverviewThe hypothetical scenarios were provided for illustrative purposes. Historical data was used to create the aforementioned hypothetical scenarios. There is no guarantee the levels illustrated would be achieved.Boring but smart: get invested, stay invested, add to portfolios over timeThe data and our message are loud and clear: get invested and stay invested. We see many wise and prudent steps you can take to preserve and create value. To preserve gains made in recent years, employ strategies that maintain market upside exposure while limiting downside risks – see Safeguarding assets: Intelligent exposure to a late-cycle bull market. You can also ensure that your portfolios are exposed to markets more likely to do well in a downturn, such as healthcare – Unstoppable trends: Increasing longevity. You can strive for a portfolio of the highest quality. And you can even add to global portfolios when markets are down, just as Warren Buffett advises. The bottom line, however, is that there is compelling evidence against aggressive attempts to time the markets, with equally weighty data in favor of keeping your core portfolio fully invested over time instead."
Strategic asset allocation is crucial to the performance and risk-exposures of portfolios over time. We review our methodology’s long-term outlook for returns.,The long-term outlook for asset classes,"Strategic asset allocation is crucial to the performance and risk-exposures of portfolios over time. We review our methodology’s long-term outlook for returns. How should you decide upon a strategic asset allocation, the way that your portfolio should be diversified globally and across asset classes over time? The answer depends, in large part, on forecast returns for asset classes over the next several years. Our methodology – Adaptive Valuation Strategies (AVS) – uses current valuations in order to forecast returns over the next ten years. We call these forecasts strategic return estimates or SREs. Citi Private Bank’s SREs provide insight into the return potential of each asset class as well as our view of the relative contribution each can make to a portfolio. For example, AVS estimates annualized returns over the next decade of 5.6% for Global Developed Equity, reflecting today’s rich valuations, the late stage of the economic cycle and, at some future point, a recession and recovery. By contrast, Global Emerging Equity is forecast to produce annualized returns of 11.6%, as various emerging markets continue their current early-stage recovery. Within Fixed Income, the more attractively-valued High Yield’s SRE of 5.5% is above that of Developed Investment Grade (3.2%) but below that of Emerging Fixed Income (5.6%). Each has a different value to add to portfolios going forward.Cash is modelled country by country, reflecting long-term real interest-rate forecasts and inflation expectations. Our US Cash SRE is 3.2%. Meanwhile, Hedge Funds – which can play an important portfolio role as a hedge during cyclical downturns – are estimated to return 7.7%. Every year, depending on market performance, the valuation of each asset class, and the correlation of the asset classes to each other, AVS adjusts its SREs and asset allocations for investors at different levels of risk tolerance. We think current SREs provide important insight into what may lie ahead for markets and why diversification in portfolios is so important to help safeguard assets. "
Aligning your investment activities with personal values and interests can help enable you to seek financial gain while serving the greater good. Our clients’ values. Citi’s values. Investing with Purpose does not require you to sacrifice returns nor is it a philanthropic endeavor. The case for sustainable investing.,Investing with Purpose,"At Citi Private Bank, we believe that you can invest in a manner that aligns with your values while maintaining quality and improving investment outcomes. We call this simultaneous pursuit of financial returns and societal benefits ‘Investing with Purpose’ (IwP). The societal benefits that IwP seeks to achieve fall into three categories: environmental, social, and governance (ESG). Examples of environmental benefits include cleaner water and more sustainable resource use. Social benefits embrace gender equality and other forms of diversity, as well as expanding access to employment, education, and finance. Governance benefits encompass raising standards of corporate behavior, such as how firms treat their employees. As we will show, companies that score well on ESG factors have achieved better financial results. In turn, investment managers who identify and invest in companies that have favorable ESG ratings have delivered better investment results in the last decade.IwP delivers societal benefits by harnessing the power of capital markets, powerful systems that channel the world’s wealth. Capital markets finance the growth of businesses, shape sectors and industries, and define what is seen as valuable. Over time, they have helped many people to build and protect great wealth. But their potential extends far beyond achieving financial returns. Investors who attribute value to companies that manage their businesses sustainably can influence and indeed transform how companies behave over time. Ultimately, this could help to solve some of the world’s most complex challenges.IwP does not require you to sacrifice returns nor is it a philanthropic endeavor. These are investments made with the expectation of competitive returns as well as the potential to help advance positive change around a wide range of issues. We know that global citizenship is as integral to many Citi Private Bank clients as it is to us. Many of our clients live the values of global citizenship by seeking innovative solutions to some of the world’s greatest challenges through their businesses, by giving back to communities, and by supporting worthy causes worldwide. A growing number of our clients have told us that they also wish to align their investment activities with their personal values and interests – and ultimately invest with greater purpose. IwP is our approach to helping to achieve this. As an organization, Citi has a stated mission of enabling growth and progress for clients and communities worldwide. Over the past two decades, we have expanded our work in environmental and inclusive finance, created an environmental and social risk management framework, and worked to manage our own environmental footprint. Central to this is our commitment to advancing the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are also the cornerstone of many approaches to sustainable investing – see graphic below. While Citi has a part to play in all of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, we are particularly focused on safeguarding the environment, assisting urban development, tackling youth unemployment, broadening financial access, promoting female economic empowerment, and enabling innovation. Our commitment to advancing these and other causes is a key element of our own global citizenship. Citi Private Bank recently reviewed an analysis of the results of more than 2,000 different academic studies that have been carried out since the early 1970s. Over half of these studies found a positive relationship between companies that score well when evaluated based on factors that align with ESG principles and corporate financial performance, while less than 10% identified a negative relationship. The clear conclusion is that companies that score well when evaluated based on ESG factors have better financial results - figure 1.The experience of sustainable investing over recent years reinforces the long-term academic findings. Our analysis suggests that investment managers who successfully identify and invest in companies that have favorable ESG ratings could have better investment results. In fact, when compared to traditional managers, ESG-focused managers have comparable returns with lower risk, resulting in superior risk-adjusted returns over time - figure 2"
Technology and innovation are strengthening investment processes and adding new dimensions to the evaluation of IwP opportunities. A spectrum of opportunities. Why Investing with Purpose is possible today. Enabling you to invest with purpose. Our commitment to a better world.,ESG equity credentials by country,"Which countries’ equity markets score highest for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in 2018?To answer this vital question, Citi Private Bank’s Office of the Chief Investment Strategist examined 1,321 firms across 22 developed countries, using ESG Risk Ratings from Sustainanalytics.These ESG Risk Ratings consider each company’s exposure to and management of financially material ESG risk factors. Our approach was bottom-up, looking at individual companies, and then developing scores for each country on a market capitalization-weighted basis. The country ESG scores are shown on a scale of 0 to 100, and compare the relative standing of each country’s equity market.The higher an individual country’s score, the better its equity market’s ESG credentials.To give perspective into ESG progress over time, we also highlight which countries’ scores increased or decreased from four years ago.In all, 58% of the companies and 77% of the countries we looked at recorded progress. There are various distinct approaches to this type of investing. We find it helpful to represent these approaches along a spectrum – figure 3.At one end of the spectrum, socially responsible investing involves screening out investments in companies or sectors that fail to meet ESG standards. Refusing to invest in particular companies or sectors – perhaps because their business processes pollute or their products cause harm – as well as advocating for higher ESG standards, may encourage them to improve. We believe that the societal benefits of this approach are hard to measure, and that the financial benefits are limited.By contrast, sustainable investing and ESG integration is a more positive approach. It actively seeks out firms with the highest ESG standards, as well as quality financial factors. The strategic integration of ESG criteria into investment processes helps quantify risks and opportunities that cannot be measured by traditional financial metrics alone, leading to more complete insights – and ultimately better portfolio and investment decisions. Sustainable investing and ESG integration are most often applied to public market investments, and mainly address core holdings within an overall investment strategy – see Core and opportunistic investing box in Our themes.At the far end of the spectrum is impact investing, involving opportunities with an even sharper focus upon positive societal impacts. Impact investments are targeted and intentional. These often seek to achieve certain specific results on the ground as well as a financial return, the so-called ‘double bottom line.’ Impact investing can take many forms. As well as being highly specific, such investments may have longer time horizons, and are less liquid. They can include expanding access to water, renewable energy, finance, education and affordable housing, for example. As such, they are more likely to constitute the opportunistic, alternative or illiquid part of an overall allocation – see Core and opportunistic investing in Our themes. Technology and innovation are strengthening investment processes and adding new dimensions to the evaluation of IwP opportunities. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are making it more possible to gather, synthesize, and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative data, and use it to understand how companies are doing with respect to ESG and other factors. They are essentially creating a new form of an information advantage, which is sought after by active investment managers. And this comes with the added benefit of valuing companies that are managing their businesses in a manner that is aligned with ESG principles. Citi Private Bank is committed to serving our clients’ growing desire to express their global citizenship by investing with purpose. We begin by helping you articulate your goals and objectives, understanding those goals and objectives, and providing you with comprehensive advice and investment strategies to meet your long-term goals and objectives. We do this by dedicating resources to the development of our advice and then by backing up our advice with a broad and deep range of investment capabilities. We are committed to partnering with asset managers to identify and develop relevant investment themes and strategies available to reflect our advice and your views. IwP adds an important new dimension to how we can work with you to understand your goals and objectives. It layers in your views when it comes to environmental, social, and governance matters. When putting your investment capital to work, it provides you with an additional dimension to express your values and ultimately to invest with broader purpose. Our differentiated approach allows you to invest without compromising your existing relationships or the due diligence rigor we apply to all investments.Eventually, we believe that this form of investing will become mainstream, that it will be a part and parcel of all robust investment processes. Until then, we will continue to integrate IwP into our broader investment capabilities. For many generations, the world’s wealthiest individuals and families have sought to drive positive societal change. Traditionally, however, they have not had the opportunity to do so via their investment portfolios. With the proliferation of ESG investments worldwide, the challenge today is to select those that combine some of the best financial prospects with alignment to the individual’s values. Through our focus on Investing with Purpose, Citi Private Bank can be your partner as you seek financial gain while serving the greater good. Working together, we can help bring about a better, more sustainable, and more inclusive world. As a global bank, Citi believes it is important for us to take a leading role in contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Private sector leadership in general is essential to help transition away from practices that undermine the  achievement of the goals, and to create solutions proactively that solve existing challenges.For example, Citi has pledged to finance $100 billion of activities to reduce climate change and help the environment. We are assisting half a million younger people worldwide to improve their employability. In inclusive finance, our direct funding is expanding access to finance and has reached more than one million low-income women around the world. And we run dedicated leadership and diversity programs within our organization to foster gender equality, something we also promote in our supply chain. The UN SDGs underscore for us the importance of our continued partnership with our clients to contribute to achieving these societal goals. The Private Bank is proud to serve clients who make contributions to their communities and to society as a whole. We aspire to enable and to emulate their global citizenship."
"After a difficult 2018, we see Asian assets returning to form in 2019, with emerging markets benefiting from attractive valuations and continuing, but slower regional growth. Our favored markets. EQUITY MARKETS: China, Japan, EQUITY SECTORS: IT, healthcare, FIXED INCOME: Short duration US dollar bonds, local currency Chinese debt. Chinese stimulus. Asian growth drivers.

China will likely remain the more interesting local currency fixed income market in 2019. Later in 2019, EM currencies may get some respite. Currencies.",Asia: Recovering markets driven by fundamental growth,"For all the turbulence in financial markets in 2018, we expect only a slight slowdown in emerging Asian economic growth over the coming year. Citi Research forecasts EM Asian real GDP not far short of the estimated 6% in 2018 and 6.1% in 2017 – figure 1. The main headwind to Asian growth is the likely impact of China’s trade standoff with the US. However, we expect China to offset some of those effects with various stimulus initiatives. As well as encouraging infrastructure spending, it has been cutting taxes to boost domestic consumption, while also easing private sector credit. Further business tax cuts and measures to ease private sector credit conditions may follow. As a result, Chinese growth could pick up somewhat after the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect 2019 real GDP growth to come close to meeting the government’s target of 6.5%. Growth may also turn higher in India, where fiscal spending might stay expansionary ahead of the general election in April-May. This may keep pressure on India’s current account deficit, but the decline in oil prices has already alleviated some concerns. Indonesia is in a similar situation, with the authorities pursuing expansionary fiscal policies, while the exchange rate is allowed to absorb external weakness. Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam are beginning to feel some benefits from companies relocating supply chains away from China. Many companies are keen to diversify their supply chains into politically stable destinations with already developed infrastructure, with the aim of avoiding US tariffs on Chinese goods. South Korea has already renewed its trade deal with the US, while its domestic politics and relations with North Korea have stabilized for now. Japan is also in a drawn out bilateral trade negotiation with the US, while its economy is experiencing tepid growth. Several factors may help EM Asia mitigate the drag upon growth from more restrictive US trade policies. Regional inflation was tame at around 2.5% in 2018 and may only reach a still-manageable 2.8% in 2019, staying contained even in more vulnerable markets like India and Indonesia. Financial resources remain intact, as most central banks chose to conserve their foreign currency reserves and let their currencies weaken during 2018’s turbulence. EM Asian currencies have weakened in excess of 7% versus the US dollar from peak to trough in 2018 – figure 2 – a factor likely to assist regional growth in 2019.Developments in the US may also prove helpful. Growth there is likely to ease back closer to its long-term trend as the effects of tax cuts fade. Whereas strong US growth pushed US rates higher and supported the dollar in 2018, these effects may reverse in 2019, benefiting emerging markets in general. Oil prices have reversed much of their rise in 2018 due to US political developments. This alleviated some of the pressure upon Asia, particularly in energy-importing nations like India and Indonesia. But supply risks remain alive, with geopolitical tensions in multiple regions. Trade tensions between the US and China remain a key risk in 2019. The truce announced at December’s G20 meeting in Buenos Aires has increased the chances for more constructive negotiations, though uncertainties remain. We think China may be willing to make significant concessions, while the US may be more inclined to negotiate in a non-election year like 2019.The rise in the cost of US dollar financing has created difficulties for marginal borrowers in EM Asia. The US Fed’s rate hike cycle is likely to remain gradual and may conclude in 2019, but until then, these pressures may remain.General elections in India and Indonesia in April-May 2019 are among the major political events in the region. Although the incumbents Modi and Widodo are both expected to win, they may have to pursue expansionary fiscal policies to enhance their electoral prospects, which could add to bond market uncertainties. Moreover, campaigning on both sides may cause social and market volatility. In 2019, we expect 2018’s sharp EM equity underperformance to reverse, at least partially. Underpinning our view is the likelihood of ongoing Asian growth accompanied by contained inflation, moderating US growth that limits the extent of US rate rises and dollar strength, and significant easing in China that helps to offset most of the drag from trade tensions. Also, strongly bearish investor positioning – particularly in China – is likely to reverse as investors diversify away from the US market. Against this backdrop, we believe the markets and sectors that sold off most heavily in 2018 - but which still have solid growth prospects - are likely to outperform. In China – one of our favored equity markets – valuations have fallen to levels last seen in 2014 – figure 3. Since that period, however, China has opened its mainland markets to greater international participation, Chinese assets have been included in broad benchmark indices, and important supply side reforms have taken place. And in 2019, MSCI is set to quadruple its inclusion factor – the percentage of actual market cap recognized for benchmark inclusion for A-shares, which remain under-represented in global portfolios - figure 5 in Unstoppable trends: The rise of Asia. The valuations in several other EM Asian markets have also dipped to compelling levels – figure 4. Singapore’s dividend yield hit 5.1% at the end of October, a figure that has been consistent with 12-month price returns of over 10%. Similarly, Taiwan’s yield is 4.8%. Such yields go a long way to compensate equity holders for taking additional risk over bonds. South Korean equities were weighed down in 2018 by corporate scandals, trade fears, geopolitics, and semiconductor industry troubles. Its IT sector – the most affected – now trades at 2001 valuations, despite the recent renewal of the Korea-US trade agreement, while tensions with North Korea have declined. As we noted, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam may be favorite destinations for companies seeking to relocate supply chains from China to avoid US tariffs. This may have contributed to those equity markets’ relative outperformance in 2018. Japan benefited from an influx of investors who had switched out of EM, but who were also skeptical of US valuations. Japanese valuations are low among developed markets, while earnings expectations are conservative. However, the country lacks robust long-term growth prospects, while its central bank’s diminishing asset purchase program is a potentially significant risk. Nonetheless, Japan’s IT and consumer sectors offer good value and many of its leading companies are themselves leaders in disruptive technologies – see Unstoppable trends: digital disruption.Indian equities erased their gains over the past year in the early autumn global market shakeout. Recent lower oil prices help to alleviate current account pressures. However, earnings growth expectations look hard to meet at 20% for 2019. Indonesian equities have actually held up within a narrow range since summer 2018, while the rupiah had weakened substantially. The country’s external vulnerability remains high. Among sectors, IT was among the most heavily sold off – figure 6. A combination of regulatory tightening and poor sentiment have caused some of the most favored names to drop by more than one third. Meanwhile, earnings growth continues, particularly in areas where monetization has not been extensive, such as online advertising and mobile payments. The region’s IT advantage stems mainly from its large and well-educated talent pool and data generation, factors that are likely to persist. Consumer industries and healthcare also sold off hard in 2018, while underlying earnings growth is still likely to last through the coming decade. In financials, insurance remains our favored sub-sector, as aging demographics and rising wealth underpin the long-term case. China has materially curtailed its unruly wealth management product industry, effectively removing the biggest competitor for insurance products. Utilities and energy are heavily regulated sectors that tend not to be able to pass on higher energy input costs. Investors seeking to take advantage of higher oil prices should look at energy producers in less regulated markets. Asian corporate fixed income markets endured significant volatility in 2018, albeit much less than regional equities and currencies. Overall, US dollar denominated Asian investment grade (IG) corporate bond benchmarks fell 1.3% through November 2018, while Asian high yield (HY) lost roughly 4.5%. More notably, HY benchmark spreads widened 230bp to nearly 600bp in 2018. Valuations have thus returned to their widest levels since 2016’s market sell-off, and are roughly 120bp wider relative to the 10-year regional average – figure 7.The weakness in fixed income in 2018 was largely attributable to US and China issues. Fed tightening and the strong US economy supported the US dollar, drawing capital away from emerging markets. So, despite low inflation, many Asian central banks were pushed into tightening monetary policy in an effort to stabilize their currencies. As US growth likely eases back towards trend in 2019 and the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle approaches, the US dollar’s momentum may moderate, and Asian credit may see investor inflows return. The pressure upon regional central banks to tighten may subside.Chinese bond defaults also weighed upon regional markets and spreads in fixed-income markets in 2018. Thirty-two Chinese issuers – including three offshore issuers – defaulted on over 80 billion yuan ($12 billion) of bonds through October 2018. This partly reflects the authorities’ greater tolerance of defaults, and also tighter credit conditions. Chinese policy easing measures designed to support liquidity – and which will be particularly targeted at private enterprise – are likely to help stabilize defaults in 2019. So, better quality US dollar denominated Chinese corporate debt appears attractive, in our view, especially given its cheaper valuations. Citi Private Bank’s Global Investment Committee is overweight Asia US dollar-denominated fixed income. In local currency fixed income, India and Indonesia are likely to see continued volatility as both countries face political uncertainty and increasing fiscal concerns, although lower oil prices in 2019 could help contain widening current account deficits. In particular, Indonesia has suffered substantial outflows of capital, which has driven bond yields sharply higher, and weakened the rupiah significantly. With 5-year bond yields near a two-year high of 8%, Indonesian local currency fixed income may outperform over the coming year, especially if the fiscal and current account concerns dissipate, allowing the rupiah to appreciate.China will likely remain the more interesting local currency fixed income market in 2019. Starting in April, nearly $3 trillion of eligible onshore China Government Bonds (CGB) will be phased in as constituents of the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index. Thus, substantial passive inflows will occur, as China is estimated to become the fourth largest bond market in aggregate fixed income benchmarks. Inflows into onshore CGBs were strong even in 2018 when the yuan depreciated substantially, thanks to the authorities’ allowing investors to hedge currency risk cheaply in the onshore forward market.In our view, Japan is still Asia’s least attractive fixed income market, owing to the Bank of Japan’s likely continued reductions of its net bond purchases. It may also shift its 10-year yield target upwards as part of its yield curve control policy. These represent significant risks to the Japanese yield curve. Other low yield markets like Korea and Thailand also offer little to fixed income investors when there are better alternatives in a higher rate environment. In 2018, Asian currencies completely reversed their gains of 2017. As measured by the Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Currency Index, Asian currencies returned to their end-2016 lows in October 2018, approaching their lowest since March 2009. Fed tightening and US dollar strength were partly responsible, along with EM capital outflows. The Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah performed worst, followed by the Australian dollar, the latter partly influenced by the Chinese yuan’s trade-dispute driven weakness. The Thai baht, Singaporean dollar, and Malaysian ringgit performed best, being seen as more resilient to the fallout from the US-China standoff. In the near term, various factors may support the US dollar, including trade friction and probable further Fed tightening. The Chinese yuan is likely to weaken further until headlines about trade become less negative. In any case, the Chinese authorities will probably continue to manage the currency closely, and it may prove a lower beta currency during bouts of risk aversion. The higher beta currencies, such as the Australian dollar and Korean won – which are influenced by the yuan – may suffer more if volatility stays elevated. The Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah could remain vulnerable ahead of those countries’ elections in April-May, given that tighter monetary and fiscal policies are unlikely before then. Later in 2019, EM currencies may get some respite. The US dollar is likely to be softer, as US growth moderates. Further Fed hikes may look less likely by the second half. The US fiscal and current account deficits may also start to weigh on the dollar once market sentiment calms. At that time, the higher beta Asian currencies may outperform."

European HY bank loans also remain an attractive source of higher current income. Currencies.",Europe: Selective opportunities amid sluggish growth,"Economic growth in Europe in 2019 is likely to be solid, albeit unspectacular. The pace of growth is slowing somewhat. However, we see few signs of an outright downturn for now. We expect GDP for the Euro area to rise by 1.7% in 2019, slightly down from the estimated 1.9% in 2018 – figure 1. This reasonable strength should be fairly broadly spread, across both the core countries – such as France and Germany – and the periphery countries – such as Spain and Portugal. We also see balanced activity across both services and manufacturing. In the face of slow growth, we also see European earnings per share growth of around 10% in 2019, representing perhaps the brightest reason to expect a reversal of fortunes here.Underlying measures of European inflation remain muted, but are rising. We expect further mild increases over the medium-term. The European Central Bank’s monetary easing program has begun to feed through into broad annualized money supply growth of 4.5% and lending growth of 4.0%. In early 2018, an escalation of trade tensions between Europe and the US seemed to be a material risk. However, we are now somewhat less concerned about the dangers after the constructive dialogue and some early follow-up in October between President Trump and European Commission President Juncker. We now think that the US might withdraw the steel and aluminum tariffs it announced in March, and which prompted retaliation from the European Union. Whether Trump will follow through on threats to extend tariffs to cars remains uncertain for now.In politics, a troubled and prolonged period of coalition-building in Spain, Italy, and Germany is over. The resulting governing coalitions are weak, which creates substantial risks for policymaking. However, this is less concerning than more fundamental political risks, such as a break-up of the Euro or European Union. Tensions between Italy’s populist government and the European Union have triggered bouts of market volatility and have held back valuations. We do not see a crisis coming to a head in 2019, however. The United Kingdom’s near-term economic prospects look highly dependent upon the outcome of the country’s negotiations to leave the European Union. Our base case for Brexit is that a deal will be struck and eventually ratified by the UK parliament, given the mounting pressure to reach agreement from both UK business and from the EU’s 27 continuing member states. If our base case proves correct, UK GDP growth may steady in 2019 at around 1.4%, having slowed to an estimated 1.2% in 2018. With improved sentiment and a recovery in foreign direct investment, growth momentum could sustain through to 2020.If the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal – either because of irreconcilable differences with the EU or because the UK’s parliament rejects a proposed deal – the UK economy is likely to contract sharply and enter a recession. Some estimates put the potential shrinkage at as much as 5%, similar to the loss of output suffered around the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. This would almost certainly be accompanied by a serious escalation of political risks. Prime Minister Theresa May could face a Conservative Party leadership challenge. There is also the possibility of a vote of no confidence in parliament, which could lead to a snap general election being called. Such a vote could result in a new government led by the Labour Party, whose hard left-wing leader’s agenda includes renationalization of key industries, and tax rises to fund redistributive policies. We do not rule out the possibility of a second referendum being held. However, this would require a larger shift in public mood in favor of such a vote than has been seen so far.Turkey’s economic challenges look far from over. However, we see limited risks of Turkish spillover to Europe, with vulnerability confined to a handful of European banks. European equities disappointed during 2018. Worse-than-expected economic performance early in the year, political uncertainty arising from prolonged attempts to build new governing coalitions in Italy, Spain, and Germany, fears of a trade conflict as well as political tensions with the US, and the risk of Turkey’s economic crisis spreading all weighed upon European markets. Looking ahead, however, we have conviction in our forecast of mid-teen total returns in 2019. One reason for this is that we expect European earnings per share growth of around 10% for the year – figure 2 – broadly spread across different sectors. Even in a worst-case scenario of Europe suffering fallout from US trade restrictions – such as disruption to supply chains – earnings growth might dip to a still positive 7% to 8%.Another driver of European returns is likely to be dividend yields, which stand at a reasonably high average of 3.3%. This raises the quality of Europe’s total return forecast. It should also help to attract inflows from yield-seeking investors in Europe. By comparison, European investment grade fixed income yields just 1.3%.European equities may also see valuations rise further, at least towards historic norms. On a cyclically-adjusted price to earnings basis (CAPE) of 19.3, Europe ex-UK equities are trading at a 25% discount relative to US equities, on 28. That compares to a historic average discount of 12%. On a price-to-book basis, Europe is 47% cheaper than the US, which is a low level by the standards of recent decades. Despite the potential for upside, equities are likely to be more volatile in the months ahead, partly reflecting their correlation with US equities. In addition, European equity volatility often rises when European corporate bond spreads rise, something we expect in 2019 – see Fixed income section below.We emphasize greater selectivity by country and region. We favor French and Swiss equities. Consensus estimates for French earnings are being revised upwards, amid signs that President Macron’s labor market reforms are beginning to have an impact on costs. Net inflows from passive investors are supporting equity prices. The yield gap between French equities and bonds has now risen to a high of over 2%, while dividends are twice covered by earnings. Swiss economic data has been firm, not held back by the strong Swiss franc. Despite having large overseas revenues, Swiss companies have continued to register robust earnings growth. This partly reflects the resilient franchises and pricing power of several of the larger Swiss companies. Swiss equity prices have fallen by more than justified given earnings growth.After a poor 2018, our favored European ex-UK sectors are financials, IT, healthcare and energy – figure 2. In financials, we expect the multi-year trend towards European banks’ improving their returns on equity (RoEs) to continue. With earnings still on average more than 50% below their pre-crisis average peak, we see potential for RoEs to rise further. Despite this, financials were 2018’s worst performing sector. And, because they make up 18% of regional equity benchmarks, they were responsible for around one-third of European equities’ 12% decline in 2018 through October.Financials’ underperformance was mainly driven by concerns over Eurozone peripheral nations, especially Italy, where the sector is under pressure from weak growth and balance sheet issues. More recently, concerns over some banks’ exposure to Turkey has weighed upon the sector. Following their sell-off, European banks trade more than 25% below their January peaks. We see the outlook as encouraging, with forecast average EPS growth of 15%, and RoEs up to 7% and expected to rise to 15%. Valuations are attractive, with average price-to-book valuations of 0.7, and dividend yields of above 4% in our preferred banks. We thus believe the present offers a compelling entry point. European information technology (IT) suffered worse than other sectors during October 2018’s sell-off. However, its fundamentals remain intact, with forecast earnings growth of 19% in 2019. IT also benefits from exposure to ongoing global growth, with approximately 67% of the sector’s revenues generated outside Europe. Despite the sector being relatively small at around 6% of European market capitalization, we see selective opportunities.Energy is the only European sector whose earnings forecasts have been revised upwards over the last six months. Energy companies are in a fundamentally better position than they were going into the oil price slump of 2014-16. Their balance sheets are stronger, while the oil price has recovered steadily. Many companies have undergone restructuring, are generating positive free cash flow, while their leverage continues to decline. The brightest outlook in Europe remains in the healthcare sector. Various positive multi-year trends will likely continue to benefit healthcare in 2019. These include rising spending, aging populations – see Unstoppable trends: Increasing longevity– and innovation in medical technology. Healthcare has previously outperformed during periods of heightened uncertainty and risk aversion thanks to its relatively stable earnings outlook. European healthcare generates only a quarter of its revenues from its home region, with over 40% coming from the Americas. The ECB’s first rate hike from its current deposit rate of -0.4% and refinancing rate of 0.0% is likely around a year away. More significantly, its asset purchases – currently running at $15bn a month – are set to finish at the end of 2018. While the ECB still needs to elaborate upon its reinvestment plans for its existing bonds when they mature, its balance sheet is likely to remain large for some time. The direction in core inflation will need to be watched closely. While currently muted, we expect inflation to move gradually closer to the ECB’s 2% target. This should allow the ECB to slowly reduce accommodation over the coming years.European sovereign bonds remain our largest fixed income underweight in our global asset allocation. Valuations are expensive. Nearly 30% of the sovereign bond market offer negative yields, with the average core Eurozone (EZ) yield around 0.3%. The ECB’s planned ending of its asset purchase program represents a major headwind. Despite the ECB’s reinvestment plans, net supply is likely to be less negative in 2019. The mild reduction in technical pressure, and improving macro outlook is likely to push bond yields upwards. Italian sovereign bonds will also remain a focus and risk barometer for investors, although we do not expect an imminent market collapse. With a sovereign debt-to-GDP ratio of 132%, a fiscal deficit target of 2.4% of GDP, and the bank sector still burdened with over €200 billion of non-performing loans, the growth rate will be the key variable. Should Italy slow more than we currently expect, its bond market could suffer, with a risk of contagion to other European sovereign markets. Italy remains our deepest Eurozone underweight. Returns in European investment grade (IG) corporate credit have been supported by low inflation and ECB quantitative easing (QE). In turn, keeping core rates low. On the other hand, spreads have widened in anticipation of the likely rise in net supply when the ECB buying program ends. Indeed, benchmark spreads have risen 60bp in 2018, nearly doubling to 130bp after reaching their tightest levels since the Global Financial Crisis. We expect spreads to widen further in 2019. Moreover, an average benchmark yield just above 1.0% leaves European IG vulnerable even to small rises in core rates. For this reason, we remain underweight in global portfolios. European high yield (HY) has benefited from investment grade investors migrating to lower quality credit in order to earn greater yields. However, this may be much less of a factor in 2019 if the end of ECB quantitative easing results in higher IG yields. Nevertheless, with default rates just under 2%, leverage stable and interest coverage at broadly comfortable levels, we remain neutral in HY. That said, around 63% of the European HY market is rated BB and yielding an anemic 3.1%. Similar to IG corporates, these bonds are more susceptible to a rise in core rates. As such, we have a preference for single ‘B’-rated issuers, where more attractive yields of around 5.7% and wider spreads can provide investors with a larger cushion against higher rates.European HY bank loans also remain an attractive source of higher current income. All-in yields are attractive as investors looking for a more liquid source of yield have bypassed the loan market altogether. As a result, Euro bank loan yields are higher, despite negative Euribor rates. For example, Single-B rated bank loans yield 6.6%, versus 5.7% for bonds. As such, the higher yields and relatively lower liquidity has helped the bank loan market outperform HY bonds in 2018, the former rising 2.8% versus the latter’s 0.5% fall. We would expect this relative outperformance to continue over the coming year.UK government bonds – or gilts – offer good liquidity and have no default risk. However, 10-year yields near 1.4% are unattractive. Without an evident path towards a Brexit deal, we would expect rate volatility to rise. In the event of no Brexit deal being reached, higher yields will probably follow. The Euro is likely to strengthen against the US dollar in 2019. We forecast a move to $1.18 over six to twelve months, and $1.30 longer-term. Our forecast is underpinned by the likelihood of the European Central Bank starting to tighten monetary policy at a time when the Federal Reserve may be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle. Also, current accounts are broadly positive or improving across Europe. Relative political certainty should also help, as we do not expect any Eurozone nation to call a referendum on currency union membership in 2019. As to valuation, the Euro looks inexpensive on a real exchange rate basis.The British pound’s direction is expected to be influenced by the progress of Brexit negotiations. Given our base case of a deal being struck and ratified, we think Sterling looks well supported on the downside. On a real-exchange rate basis, sterling looks attractively valued. In addition, the Bank of England is expected to hike interest rates twice after the UK’s exit from the EU during the first stage of the transition period. Our long-term forecast is for the pound to rise from $1.28 today to $1.48, but that is dependent upon the establishment of a post-Brexit roadmap for the UK, as well as low domestic political turbulence.
