* Not for nothing has Fed Chairman Powell celebrated the “extraordinary times” the US economy enjoyed in 2018: growth is on pace to exceed 3%, the unemployment rate is at a 48-year low, and inﬂation is right on target. As we look ahead to 2019, the natural question is how long the good times can last.* Growth is likely to slow signiﬁcantly next year, from a recent pace of 3?%+ to roughly our 1?% estimate of potential by end-2019. We expect tighter ﬁnancial conditions and a fading ﬁscal stimulus to be the key drivers of the deceleration.* Robust job creation should push the unemployment rate to 3% by early 2020, well below our 4?% estimate of full employment, the rate consistent with 2% inﬂation. Wage growth should reach 3?-3?% in this environment, and ﬁrmer wage pressures coupled with additional tariff rounds should boost core PCE inﬂation to 2?% by end-2019. While Fed ofﬁcials would be comfortable with inﬂation at that level, we also see a risk of a more material inﬂation overshoot.* The Fed is very likely to raise rates in December, and we expect 4 more hikes in 2019 to bring the terminal funds rate to 3?-3?%, about two hikes above market forwards. With a large overshoot of its labor market target under way, the FOMC will likely be reluctant to stop until it is conﬁdent that the unemployment rate is no longer on a downward trajectory, a point we expect to reach only in early 2020. We still see the risks to our terminal rate forecast as tilted a little to the upside.* History counsels that large labor market overshoots raise recession risk down the road. While we take this lesson seriously, we think it is being applied too mechanically in markets today. A ﬂatter and more anchored Phillips curve should allow the Fed to unwind the overshoot more gradually, giving it a good chance of beating the historical odds. For now, neither overheating risks nor ﬁnancial imbalances—the classic causes of US recessions—look worrisome. As a result, the expansion is on course to become the longest in US history next year, and even in subsequent years recession is not our base case.

The Home StretchNot for nothing has Fed Chairman Powell celebrated the “extraordinary times” the US economy enjoyed in 2018. GDP growth is on pace  to  exceed  3%,  boosted  in  part  by ﬁscal stimulus. The unemployment rate has fallen to a 48-year low, and a wide range of labor market indicators paints a picture of one of the strongest job markets in memory. And after anxiety about “lowﬂation” last year, core PCE inﬂation has been remarkably on target, within 5bp of 2% for the last ﬁve months.On the monetary policy front, the Fed appears very likely to deliver its fourth rate hike of 2018 in December, following four tightening actions in 2017 as well. But in contrast to 2017, in 2018 the Fed’s policy actions were matched by a large tightening in broader ﬁnancial conditions, as shown in Exhibit 1.Exhibit 1: In 2018 the Fed’s Rate Hikes Were Matched By a Large Tightening in Financial ConditionsIndex	Index

But before the economy stabilizes, we expect the unemployment rate to fall even further below target to a bottom of 3% in early 2020. This is well below our 4?% estimate of full employment, and we therefore expect to see faster wage growth and an increase in core inﬂation to 2?% by the end of next year. The FOMC is likely to judge it prudent to keep its foot gently on the brake until it can be conﬁdent that the unemployment rate is no longer on a downward trajectory, and we therefore expect four more hikes in 2019 to a terminal rate of 3?-3?%.For ﬁnancial markets, this combination of less growth, more inﬂation, and more rate hikes than priced could be challenging. But a meaningful deceleration next year would help to reduce the risk of eventually overheating and could ultimately extend the life of the expansion.
The Economic Outlook for 2019: Less Growth, More InﬂationThe tightening in ﬁnancial conditions and the fading of the ﬁscal stimulus are the key drivers of the growth deceleration we expect next year. Our estimate of the sum of the growth impulses from these two factors declines from a ?pp boost in 2018Q3  to a ?pp net drag by mid-2019, as shown in Exhibit 2.Exhibit 2: Tighter Financial Conditions and a Fading Fiscal Boost Should Drive Growth Lower in 2019Percentage points	Percentage points

The economy’s recent performance has been stronger than the ﬁscal and ﬁnancial impulses alone would suggest, and some of this additional self-sustaining momentum should persist next year.We expect consumption growth of about 2?% in 2019, supported by solid income growth, a high saving rate, and high conﬁdence. We project business investment growth of about 4%, supported by strong demand growth, fairly easy credit conditions, and healthy business conﬁdence. Strength in these areas should be only partly offset by drags from net trade and continued weakness in the housing sector.While further escalation of trade tensions with China appears likely, we have found minimal effects on the US economy so far and the next steps should have only a modest impact on growth unless they affect US business conﬁdence and risk assets much more adversely than the trade war has to date.

Source: Department of Commerce, Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchWith growth likely to remain above potential a while longer, the impressive recent momentum in job creation is likely to fade only gradually. Monthly payroll growth has averaged 215k over the last six months, and our statistical models suggest that it is unlikely to slow to our 90k estimate of the breakeven pace—the pace needed to stabilize the unemployment rate—until early 2020 (Exhibit 4, left). By then we expect the unemployment rate to have declined to 3%, well below our 4.5% estimate of the full employment rate consistent with the Fed’s 2% inﬂation target (Exhibit 4, right).Exhibit 4: Above-Trend Job Creation Is Likely to Push the Unemployment Rate to 3% by Early 2020Thousands per month	Thousands per month	Percent	Percent

Source: Department of Labor, Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchOther indicators support this picture of one of the strongest labor markets in memory. The number of job openings per unemployed worker, the quit rate, household reports of the ease of ﬁnding a job, and employer reports of the difﬁculty of ﬁnding workers all suggest that workers’ bargaining power has increased. Based on these signals, recent
acceleration in the highest-quality wage indicators, the rise in our wage survey leading indicator, and the larger pick-up in wage growth in the more cyclically-sensitive lower half of the income distribution, we expect overall wage growth to reach 3.25-3.5% next year.Core PCE inﬂation is likely to grind higher next year as well. While recent inﬂation readings have been soft, we expect to reach 2?% by end-2019. Measures of the underlying inﬂation trend have risen, and in the year ahead pass-through from ﬁrmer wage growth, bottlenecks and capacity constraints in product markets, additional tariff rounds with a greater focus on consumer goods, and new state-level online sales taxes should all put upward pressure on core inﬂation.Exhibit 5: Firmer Wage Pressures and Higher Tariffs Should Boost Core PCE Inﬂation to 2?% by End-2019

2018	2019*Tariffs already imposed include those on solar panels, washing machines, steel, aluminum, and $250bn of Chinese imports; our base case involves an increase in the tariff rate from 10% to 25% on $200bn of Chinese imports as well as a new 10% tariff on the remaining $267bn of Chinese imports. While not our base case, a 25% tariff rate on this $267bn and/or on the majority of the $340bn of global auto-sector imports are also possible from the administration (represented in the gray area above).Note: Tariff chart shows estimated impact on core PCE inflation; however, we estimate an impact of a similar magnitude on the core CPI measure.Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchWhile Fed ofﬁcials would be comfortable with inﬂation at that level, we also see some risk of a larger overshoot to 2.5% or higher in the years ahead, a level that would likely change the monetary policy conversation. Part of the reason is simply that inﬂation risk is always higher than it seems. While this statistical uncertainty is a two-sided risk, we also see upside risks from trade war escalation beyond our baseline, such as the imposition of auto tariffs, and from the possibility suggested by our analysis of city-level data that extremely tight labor markets can and often do push inﬂation notably, not just slightly, higher.
The Fed in 2019: The Home Stretch of the Hiking CycleWe expect the Fed to deliver a rate hike in December followed by four hikes in 2019, about two more than priced. This would bring the terminal funds rate to 3?-3?% and mark the third straight year in which the Fed surprised markets in a hawkish direction.In 2017 investor skepticism about rate hikes centered on the lowﬂation narrative, the weight the FOMC was likely to put on low inﬂation versus a tight labor market, and the level of the neutral rate. In 2018 investor skepticism centered on the idea of the neutral rate as a barrier,  an assumed fear of yield curve inversion, and concern about foreign      and especially EM vulnerability to Fed hikes. As we enter the home stretch of the hiking cycle in 2019, investor skepticism has so far centered on whether four hikes are really necessary for an economy already on a trajectory to decelerate substantially.The next three hikes up to the Fed’s 3% estimate of the neutral rate (Exhibit 6) appear likely to be fairly uncontroversial, barring a signiﬁcant shock.   Recent commentary by    Fed  ofﬁcials indicates that most think that an accommodative stance is inappropriate at   a time when the economy is past their labor market target. The controversy is likely to begin beyond 3%.Exhibit 6: Most FOMC Participants Now Agree that an Accommodative Policy Stance Is InappropriatePercent	Percent

But since last December FOMC participants have overwhelmingly projected that a terminal rate modestly above neutral will be an appropriate response to the labor market overshoot. And compared to standard benchmarks such as the “balanced approach” Taylor rule included in the Fed’s Monetary Policy Report, taking the funds rate a hike or two above neutral actually looks very restrained (Exhibit 7).

The recent sharp tightening in ﬁnancial conditions has made it more plausible that this point could be reached earlier than the end of next year, but we think it is more likely that job growth will not slow sufﬁciently until early 2020. If so, the FOMC is likely to judge it prudent to continue tightening gradually, for fear of having to tighten more abruptly down the road. This has been the Committee’s guiding principle for the last couple of years.Exhibit 8 illustrates a few possible alternative scenarios around our baseline. If GDP growth and job creation slow earlier than we expect, the Fed could stop after two hikes next year at 2.75-3%, say.   Conversely,  if job growth remains stronger for longer than     we expect or inﬂation rises to 2.5% or higher,  the path of least resistance would likely     be to continue hiking once per quarter into 2020.  While many scenarios are possible,     we see the risks to our baseline terminal rate as still tilted a little to the upside.

Our best guess remains that runoff will end with bank reserves at roughly $1tn and a total balance sheet of about $3.6tn in early 2020, though a wide range of outcomes is possible. While we sympathize with arguments that the beneﬁts of keeping the balance sheet somewhat larger than its minimum possible size exceed the costs, the Fed’s standing guidance, reiterated in Congressional testimony by Chairman Powell in July, is that the “balance sheet will return to a size that’s no larger than it needs to be for us to affect monetary policy in our chosen framework,” and that point looks a bit further off.Second, the FOMC will likely have to make further IOER realignments. With the effective fed funds rate now just 5bp below the top of the target range for the funds rate, we expect the FOMC to raise IOER by only 20bp at its December meeting and to make one or two additional IOER realignments in 2019.Third, a press release from the Fed issued yesterday announced that the debate on alternative monetary policy frameworks has resumed.  We  expect the next milestone to be a summary of a staff presentation in the minutes to one of the upcoming FOMC meetings. The key event in 2019 will then be a conference on June 4-5 that will invite discussion from both within and outside of the Federal Reserve.
Beating the Historical Odds: Recession Risk in 2019 and BeyondWe have long highlighted the risks that have historically been associated with large overshoots of full employment. We have noted that the Fed has never engineered a soft landing from beyond full employment, that few other advanced economy central banks have either, and that countries that have achieved very long expansions often used countercyclical policy to prevent a large overshoot in the ﬁrst place. In practice it hasn’t been easy to nudge up the unemployment rate just so.While we take this lesson seriously, we think it is being applied too mechanically by market participants today. The key difference with the past is that the Phillips curve is ﬂatter and better anchored on the Fed’s target today. As a result, where labor market overshoots once led to high and accelerating inﬂation and consequently had to be unwound urgently with a forceful policy response, today an overshoot will more likely mean inﬂation persistently but only moderately above target. The Fed could probably live with this for a while, permitting it to tighten gradually and unwind the overshoot slowly. This gives the Fed a good chance of beating the historical odds.How worried should we be about recession risk today? The history of US recessions points to two classic causes of US recessions, overheating and ﬁnancial imbalances. While overheating risks could emerge down the road, they look quite limited for now: core inﬂation is at 2%, trend unit labor cost growth is at 2%, and both household inﬂation expectations and market-implied inﬂation compensation are below average (Exhibit 9).Exhibit 9: Overheating Risks Look Limited for Now

Source: Department of Commerce, Federal Reserve Board, University of Michigan, Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchWe also see little risk from ﬁnancial imbalances at the moment. At a high level, the private sector ﬁnancial balance—a very good predictor of recession risk—looks quite healthy (Exhibit 10).Digging deeper, our ﬁnancial excess monitor looks for elevated valuations and stretched risk appetite across major asset classes, and for ﬁnancial imbalances and vulnerabilities
in the household, business, banking, and government sectors. Overall, the message is mostly reassuring. On the valuations side, while commercial real estate prices look somewhat frothy, lending terms and standards have tightened in recent years. On the sectoral imbalances side, ﬁscal sustainability remains a long-run concern, but we see this less as a recession trigger than as something that could prolong a downturn if policymakers perceive a lack ﬁscal space to respond.These two classic recession risks are complementary—overheating and the associated risk of a more abrupt shift in monetary policy is more threatening when ﬁnancial imbalances are elevated and less threatening when they are limited. With neither risk looking worrisome at the moment, we do not think it makes sense to characterize the economy as “late cycle” at this point.Exhibit 10: The Private Sector Financial Balance Looks Healthy, a Key Contrast with the Last Two CyclesPercent of GDP	Percent of GDP12	1210	108	86	64	42	20	0-2	-2-4	-4-6	-61960	1965	1970	1975	1980	1985	1990	1995	2000	2005	2010	2015Source: Federal Reserve, Department of Commerce, Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchThe most obvious recession risk beyond 2019 is a mundane and technical one. With a low potential growth rate and a possible need to operate the economy a touch below potential to gradually unwind the overshoot—we forecast 1.5% growth in 2020 and 2021—the likelihood that normal ﬂuctuations will tip growth negative is mechanically somewhat higher. We would interpret this as simply highlighting the arbitrariness of deﬁning recessions as negative growth, rather than as a material rise in the unemployment rate. Of course, even a less severe recession could see a large sell-off in risk assets.Accounting for these and other considerations, our recession risk model indicates that recession risk is still quite low (Exhibit 11). The expansion is therefore on course to become the longest in US history next year, and even in subsequent years recession is not our base case.

Other than disclosures relating to Goldman Sachs, this research is based on current public information that we consider reliable, but we do not represent it is accurate or complete, and it should not be relied on as such. The information, opinions, estimates and forecasts contained herein are as of the date hereof and are subject to change without prior notiﬁcation. We seek to update our research as appropriate, but various regulations may prevent us from doing so. Other than certain industry reports published on a periodic basis, the large majority of reports are published at irregular intervals as appropriate in the analyst’s judgment.Goldman Sachs conducts a global full-service, integrated investment banking, investment management, and brokerage business. We have investment banking and other business relationships with a substantial percentage of the companies covered by our Global Investment Research Division.Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, the United States broker dealer, is a member of SIPC (http://www.sipc.org).Our salespeople, traders, and other professionals may provide oral or written market commentary or trading strategies to our clients and principal trading desks that reﬂect opinions that are contrary to the opinions expressed in this research. Our asset management area, principal trading desks and investing businesses may make investment decisions that are inconsistent with the recommendations or views expressed in this research.The analysts named in this report may have from time to time discussed with our clients, including Goldman Sachs salespersons and traders, or may discuss in this report, trading strategies that reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term impact on the market price of the equity securities discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analyst’s published price target expectations for such stocks. Any such   trading strategies are distinct from and do not affect the analyst’s fundamental equity rating for such stocks, which rating reﬂects a stock’s return potential relative to its coverage group as described herein.We and our afﬁliates, ofﬁcers, directors, and employees, excluding equity and credit analysts, will from time to time have long or short positions in, act as principal in, and buy or sell, the securities or derivatives, if any, referred to in this research.The views attributed to third party presenters at Goldman Sachs arranged conferences, including individuals from other parts of Goldman Sachs, do not necessarily reﬂect those of Global Investment Research and are not an ofﬁcial view of Goldman Sachs.Any third party referenced herein, including any salespeople, traders and other professionals or members of their household, may have positions in the products mentioned that are inconsistent with the views expressed by analysts named in this report.This research is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation would be illegal. It does not constitute a personal recommendation or take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. Clients should consider whether any advice or recommendation in this research is suitable for their particular circumstances and, if appropriate, seek professional advice, including tax advice. The price and value of investments referred to in this research and the income from them may ﬂuctuate. Past performance is not a guide to future performance, future returns are not guaranteed, and a loss of original capital may occur.Fluctuations in exchange rates could have adverse effects on the value or price of, or income derived from, certain investments.Certain transactions, including those involving futures, options, and other derivatives, give rise to substantial risk and are not suitable for all investors. Investors should review current options disclosure documents which are available from Goldman Sachs sales representatives or at http://www.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. Transaction costs may be signiﬁcant in option strategies calling for multiple purchase and sales of options such as spreads. Supporting documentation will be supplied upon request.Differing Levels of Service provided by Global Investment Research: The level and types of services provided to you by the Global Investment Research division of GS may vary as compared to that provided to internal and other external clients of GS, depending on various factors including your individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communication, your risk proﬁle and investment focus and perspective (e.g., marketwide, sector speciﬁc, long term, short term), the size and scope of your overall client relationship with GS, and legal and regulatory constraints. As an example, certain clients may request to receive notiﬁcations when research on speciﬁc securities is published, and certain clients may request that speciﬁc data underlying analysts’ fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst’s fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports.
All research reports are disseminated and available to all clients simultaneously through electronic publication to our internal client websites. Not all research content is redistributed to our clients or available to third-party aggregators, nor is Goldman Sachs responsible for the redistribution of our research by third party aggregators. For research, models or other data related to one or more securities, markets or asset classes (including related services) that may be available to you, please contact your GS representative or go to http://360.gs.com.Disclosure information is also available at http://www.gs.com/research/hedge.html or from Research Compliance, 200 West Street, New York, NY 10282.© 2018 Goldman Sachs.No part of this material may be (i) copied, photocopied or duplicated in any form by any means or (ii) redistributed without the prior written consent of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
