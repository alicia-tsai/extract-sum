Drivers likely to extend the cycle ,"From technology and USD stability to emerging markets rebalancing, we review six key market drivers and risks in 2019. Keeping inflation under control. US dollar stability. China’s resilience. Calmer European politics. Emerging markets rebalancing. Tech and healthcare innovations. The best of all worlds is a fairly stable USD.","Growth momentum in advanced economies seems strong enough to extend the cycle into 2019 and beyond. The more important question for markets is whether inflation will remain as benign as it has been. If inflation rises significantly more than markets (and we) currently expect, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will be seen as being behind the curve. Bond yields would further increase significantly, while equities and other risk assets would likely decline substantially. Barring an unlikely surge in productivity, wage growth will be the key driver of inflation. Gyrations of the USD tend to destabilize the world economy and financial markets. USD strength, as seen in H1 2018, can put severe strain on economies that require cheap dollar funding. Significant USD weakness puts pressure on export champions, such as Germany and Japan. It also raises the specter of inflation as commodity prices tend to rise sharply in response to a weak USD. The best of all worlds is a fairly stable USD. With Fed tightening well advanced, and the European Central Bank as well as the Bank of Japan gradually catching up, chances are good that the USD will indeed be stable. US trade policy is putting considerable strain on China. Moreover, after the USA recently renegotiated trade agreements with Mexico, Canada and South Korea, and amid de-escalating trade tensions with Europe, the US trade stance towards China could harden further. China’s patience is thus likely to be additionally tested. If its policymakers proceed cautiously, as in 2018, risks of instability should be limited and the expansion can be extended. Aggressive currency policy, credit easing or foreign policy, would be destabilizing, however. Eurozone growth is expected to remain above potential in 2019, thanks in part to still loose monetary conditions. We expect political stresses to calm down to some extent. The exit of Britain from the European Union (EU), slated for 29 March 2019, should not do much harm to either side if handled wisely. In Germany, the ongoing political realignment is unlikely to cause instability, as the influence of the extreme parties remains limited. Meanwhile, we believe that Italy and the EU will ultimately find a compromise over the country’s budget deficit while reaffirming Italy’s euro membership. Emerging markets (EM) entered the financial crisis with fairly healthy balance sheets. After 2008, cheap USD funds seduced EM, especially corporations, to substantially boost their foreign currency borrowing. Yet with the costs of USD liquidity rising in 2018 as a result of a more hawkish Fed, stresses emerged and some EM currencies suffered severe setbacks. At the end of 2018, there were indications that internal and external balance was being restored, in part with the support of the International Monetary Fund. If that process continues in 2019, EM can recover and global investors would benefit. Technology stocks have been the dominant driver of global equity markets in the past decade. The MSCI World IT sector has outperformed the overall ­market by approximately 200% since March 2009. Social media, online shopping and ever more elaborate hand-held devices have taken the world by storm. An important question for investors is whether growth in this sector will remain this strong, with the emergence of new areas of focus such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence. A second key sector that is likely to influence the fate of equity markets is healthcare, with investors keeping an eye on gene therapy and other innovative treatments. "
"Stimulus fades, but growth remains ","The impact of US fiscal stimulus is likely to fade, but “easy money,” healthy capital expenditure as well as continued employment and wage growth should extend the cycle in advanced economies. Growth in China is set to slow further as policymakers opt for stability rather than strong stimulus. A resolution of the trade conflicts would support business confidence, investment spending and growth. Fiscal stimulus reduced. Companies keep investing. Consumer spending should remain robust in most advanced economies. China in a holding pattern. Upside and downside risks.","The synchronized global expansion of 2017 gave way to a disparate growth picture in 2018. After weakness at the start of the year, US economic growth accelerated substantially on the back of cuts in corporate and personal taxes. In China, GDP growth held up better than expected despite government measures to rein in excess credit growth. As the US Federal Reserve (Fed) turned more hawkish in the spring of 2018, stresses began to appear in various emerging markets (EM), most prominently Argentina and Turkey. To protect their currencies from further depreciation, a number of EM central banks tightened policy, significantly weakening growth momentum. The weaker external demand from EM is likely one of the reasons why growth in the Eurozone moderated in the first few months of 2018. Our base case for 2019 sees a moderate slowdown in global GDP growth relative to 2018, chiefly due to fading policy stimulus in the USA and policy tightening in EM ex-China (see forecast on page 31). While certain aspects of the US tax reform should continue to enhance household cash flows and remain supportive for companies, the impact of US fiscal stimulus is set to diminish. Across other advanced economies, we expect fiscal policy to be largely neutral apart from minor stimulus in Japan, and possibly the Eurozone. In contrast, many EM governments will likely be forced to tighten fiscal policy. In most advanced economies, monetary policy remains fairly loose compared to both the pre-crisis years and much of the post-financial crisis years. It should remain accommodative in 2019 even with further normalization, despite a number of rate hikes. US monetary policy is still not particularly tight (see chart on page 18). Yet in 2019, it should gradually dampen US growth even if its impact may once again be greater in EM given the key role USD liquidity plays for many of these markets. Barring a significant worsening of the global trade conflicts – or other triggers of greater uncertainty – we expect corporate capital expenditure (capex) to continue to expand in 2019. The need to adapt supply chains in response to tariffs may itself trigger some investment spending. Corporate investment is key to extending the cycle as government stimulus fades. In late 2018, business optimism remained strong, especially in the USA, while capacity constraints were still tightening and funding conditions remained benign. Many companies are likely to further expand their market share in 2019, be it via capex or mergers and acquisitions. Growth companies generally have healthy balance sheets and strong cash positions. Moreover, high energy prices are likely to be supportive as well given the continued importance of energy-related capex. Finally, claims that companies that buy back stocks have less funds for capex do not hold up to closer scrutiny – at least not in the USA. In fact, a bottom-up study of the S&P 500 universe by Credit Suisse analysts demonstrates that the two activities, which both reflect balance sheet strength, correlate positively. Given high and still rising employment rates and accelerating wage growth, consumer spending should also remain robust in most advanced economies. China’s strong foreign asset position and low inflation give its policymakers more leeway in their actions than in many EM. At the same time, given the high debt levels of state-owned companies and local governments, Chinese policymakers are likely to refrain from returning to aggressive credit stimulus. Instead, they are likely to do just enough to prevent US tariffs from significantly depressing growth. They are also unlikely to opt for significant RMB depreciation. Meanwhile, the contribution of household spending to growth will be constrained because mortgage debt and debt service (almost 30% of household income, according to our estimates) have increased substantially on the back of rising real estate prices. Although China’s growth rates remain far above the global average, its contribution to global growth will probably flatten or even decline after the 2017 recovery (see chart below). Our outlook for growth in other EM remains more cautious, though there are significant differences across countries. In countries with vulnerable external balances, the setbacks of 2018 are likely to extend into 2019 as policy continues to focus on currency stabilization. Political uncertainties will add to downside risks in a number of countries. Meanwhile, in countries such as Russia, higher commodity export revenues should offset pressure from tighter USD liquidity. Of course, there are both downside and upside risks to our base case. On the downside, country-specific issues such as Italy’s fiscal situation might weaken Europe’s growth outlook. A sharper-than-expected slowdown in China would most affect other Asian economies, but would also impact Europe. Significant setbacks in financial markets (e.g. triggered by an unexpected rise in inflation and subsequent fears of faster monetary policy tightening in the USA) could hurt confidence. However, a resolution of the trade conflicts would support business confidence, investment spending and growth. It would also provide new impulses for an extension of the expansion."
Spotlight,What makes the business cycle go round? Shocks drive manufacturing cycles. USA in driver’s seat. A key risk is that the positive impact of US demand fades and there is nobody to take USA in driver’s seat over the baton.,"Long-term growth trends and business cycle fluctuations have a significant impact on financial markets. This Investment Outlook focuses mostly on the latter. Business cycles are driven by fluctuations (shocks) in aggregate demand or aggregate supply. The most common supply shocks result from sudden changes in the cost of widely used raw materials, especially oil. Aggregate demand shocks result from shifts in monetary or fiscal policy, which stimulate or restrain private spending. Excesses or shortages of manufacturing inventories also trigger business cycle fluctuations by affecting the momentum of industrial production (IP). Our economists note that global IP typically slumps every 3–4 years, a pattern visible in US and UK data since the 19th century. While such slumps corresponded with overall recessions up to the early 1980s, this is no longer the case, probably because the weight of manufacturing employment in the economy has declined and countercyclical monetary policy has become more effective. Given that 2015 was the most recent slump year, our risk scenario is for the next phase of global IP weakness to occur in late 2019 or 2020. Although the US economy is relatively closed in terms of international trade, it is a key driver of the global business cycle. This is likely because US policymakers are more focused on stabilizing employment and domestic consumption than other countries, and because their decisions have a stronger impact on the global economy via financial markets. In all but one period (the aftermath of the financial crisis), the USA has been a positive driver of the global business cycle (see chart on page 21). The Eurozone’s impact has been much weaker, except in the pre-2008 boom. Since then, the region has been a major drag on the global business cycle. China only provided a cyclical boost in the years after 2008. Looking ahead, a key risk is that the positive impact of US demand fades and there is nobody to take over the baton."
World follows US Fed’s tightening path,"Our base case foresees a gradual rise of inflation in advanced economies and fairly stable inflation in emerging markets, albeit with significant dispersion. We expect monetary policy to continue to tighten globally, but at a moderate pace. More money in workers’ pockets. Beware the inflation jokers. Emerging markets take a different path. Interest rates to rise.","The evolution of inflation in the major economies, especially the USA and the Eurozone, will be a key driver of financial markets in 2019. Upside inflation surprises pose a greater risk to bond and equity markets than limited disappointments in economic growth. January 2018 was a case in point, as a minor upward surprise in US wage inflation triggered the year’s largest correction in equities. According to our base case, core inflation will rise modestly in the USA, Eurozone and several other developed economies in 2019 as capacity constraints tighten. By late 2019, unemployment rates in the USA and Europe will likely approach 20-year lows. Labor markets are tight in Germany, the UK, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. Even Japanese wages are now rising after declining for most of the past two decades. That said, the absolute rate of wage gains is still well below pre-crisis highs, including in the USA. Yet barring an unforeseen economic shock, we believe labor markets should continue to tighten, pushing wages up further. Academic literature has suggested that wage gains have been more subdued since the financial crisis due to the increased buying power of large corporations, especially in the services sector. However, labor shortages in these areas seem to have increased quite significantly as well, and company-level evidence suggests that wage gains are accelerating. Wage inflation does not translate directly into price inflation. Other costs, including interest expenses and input costs (especially for raw materials such as oil) are key drivers of headline inflation. The significant increases in oil prices in 2007 and 2008 as well as in 2011 were the main reason why headline inflation rose at the time. If our global growth scenario holds, the price of oil and other cyclical commodities could rise further in 2019. Interest costs are also likely to creep up. Given strong final demand growth, the share of costs absorbed by corporate profits is unlikely to rise, as such increases typically occur when demand is weak. While we expect labor productivity measures in the USA and other developed markets to move higher, we do not believe this will markedly dampen inflation. In summary, with average inflation in advanced economies already close to the previous mid-cycle period (2004/05) levels, a further increase in inflation seems likely (see forecast on page 31). In emerging markets (EM) inflation may take a different path than in advanced economies. After 2011, inflation in EM diverged from the advanced economies as growth remained robust in the former and weakened in the latter following the Eurozone crisis. Inflation in EM then declined on the heels of lower oil prices and weakening growth in China. Looking ahead, headline inflation in EM may rise to some extent due to higher energy prices and the broad weakening of EM currencies in 2018. Yet we believe it is likely that monetary authorities in most EM countries will focus on steadying currencies, helping inflation stabilize in the course of 2019. The base case of continued economic growth and moderately rising inflation suggests that monetary policy will tighten in most advanced and some emerging economies in 2019. At the time of writing, the futures market implied that the Fed funds rate would end up below 3% by the end of 2019. This would imply one to two further rate hikes in 2019, after a likely hike in December 2018, taking the real Fed funds rate to about 1%, broadly in line with our forecast. At its September 2018 meeting, the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee removed the reference to its policy being “accommodative.” While the Fed’s new chairman, Jerome Powell, has eschewed precise estimates of “neutral” interest rates, consensus estimates of neutral are typically near 3%. Hence many market participants will probably consider US policy close to tight by the end of 2019. The European Central Bank (ECB), however, is set to end net asset purchases at the end of 2018 and unlikely to hike rates before H2 2019. Thus, its policy will remain accommodative. In 2018, EM central banks have had to contend with tighter Fed policy and an appreciating USD. The risk case for them is that the USD experiences a further marked appreciation while global growth weakens. That would make things very difficult for policymakers. Even in the more benign case of solid global growth and no broad USD uptrend, EM central bank rates will tend to rise rather than fall given rising rates in advanced economies. However, we still expect most central bank rates globally to end 2019 well below the peaks of the previous cycle. This is consistent with the fact that this cycle is not driven by a significant credit boom, featuring extensive economic overheating. "
The global economy’s stress test,"Economic downturns or financial crises typically occur when an economy exhibits significant imbalances. Compared to 2007, household imbalances are markedly lower in the USA but fiscal imbalances are greater. In the Eurozone, both the external and fiscal balances have improved. In emerging markets (EM), the picture is mixed. Corporates have significantly lengthened the maturity of their borrowing so that the passthrough from rising interest rates to interest costs will be much slower than in past cycles. US households in better shape. Eurozone juggles high debt, low growth. Similar to the USA, the UK also continues to exhibit a twin deficit. Emerging markets: The strong outnumber the fragile. China curbs appetite for debt. Crisis risks are still rare. The trade dispute with the USA or other potential shocks pose a dilemma for China’s policymakers, as they may need to provide renewed stimulus to prevent a sharper growth slowdown. But a crisis seems unlikely. ","Our base case for the global economy is moderately optimistic despite some risks, as we described earlier. Nevertheless, key countries do have potential vulnerabilities compared with previous pre-recession or pre-crisis years. The chart (see page 28) presents a spider web for a relatively broad range of US economic and financial indicators that allow for a differentiated risk assessment. Comparing the current period with past pre-recession situations yields the following results: The US labor market, as measured by the unemployment gap, looks slightly tighter than in 2007. Yet inflation pressures are lower, suggesting less need for outright tight monetary policy. This distinction is important because phases of overtightening have tended to act as catalysts for later recessions (e.g. in 1991). Ə US households are in much better shape than in 2007. While higher interest rates will gradually boost debt service payments, the risk to the economy appears limited. This is also due to less stretched real estate valuations, which suggests that the housing market is far less likely to trigger a downturn. Ə Corporate balance sheets are more exposed, however. So long as interest rates are fairly low and growth is robust, it should be unproblematic for corporates to find funding. A sharper hike in rates and/or an economic slowdown would be more worrisome, however. But bond spreads appear to already discount higher corporate risks. Moreover, corporates have significantly lengthened the maturity of their borrowing so that the pass-through from rising interest rates to interest costs will be much slower than in past cycles. The external imbalance (i.e. current account relative to GDP) is more benign than in past pre-recession periods. But it has been worsening since 2013 and is projected to further deteriorate. Ə The fiscal imbalance is higher than in past pre-recession periods. Prior to the 2001 recession, the federal budget reached a surplus of more than 2.5% of GDP; in mid-2007 the deficit was just above 1% of GDP. Despite nearly10 years of expansion, the deficit is currently at about 4% of GDP and likely to deteriorate further due to the 2018 tax cuts. Ə Public sector debt has been rising and is above 100% of GDP (large unfunded public sector liabilities are not included here). At current moderate interest rate levels, financing the debt is fairly unproblematic. A significant rise in rates would make matters worse, however, and could push interest costs as a share of GDP up sharply. An outright default of the US government is nevertheless very improbable given the Fed’s potential role as lender of last resort. But in an economy operating at full capacity, easier Fed policy could increase inflation risks. Conversely, while tax increases or spending cuts might help fiscal dynamics, they would create headwinds to growth. Still, our view is that fiscal profligacy is unlikely to be a major issue for financial markets in 2019. In the Eurozone, the key vulnerabilities – i.e. the fiscal balance and member countries’ external balance – have improved substantially compared to 2007 (see chart below). The key issue for the Eurozone is high government debt, especially in Italy, coupled with low economic growth. Moreover, given that the ECB is winding down its asset purchases (i.e. quantitative easing), pressures on public sector debt may increase. Considering the huge size of Italian debt (approximately EUR 2.3 trillion, or 130% of GDP), any sign that the government is indeed moving away from fiscal discipline could have highly destabilizing effects beyond Italy, not least because the Italian banking sector remains quite exposed to government debt. While the fundamental risk of instability has diminished in the Eurozone, the picture for the UK is less clear. Similar to the USA, the UK also continues to exhibit a twin deficit. In its case, the external balance is more prominent than the fiscal deficit. It seems unlikely that this situation will evolve into a financial crisis given the Bank of England’s credibility, but in case of continued uncertainty over relations with the EU, questions regarding the funding of the external imbalance may arise. The fragilities in EM as a group are fairly limited, in our view. However, the reliance on foreign savings was significant in selected countries, notably Argentina, Turkey and South Africa, and should have been seen as a warning sign. Yet the external imbalances are less serious in other key countries such as Brazil, Mexico or Indonesia. Compared to the 1990s, the situation has in fact improved dramatically. Countries that witnessed a major crisis at that time, notably Thailand and Malaysia, have significantly improved their current accounts. But fiscal discipline has deteriorated to some extent in most countries. China is in a special fiscal situation: central government debt is not very high, but debt of state-owned enterprises and local governments has increased sharply since the financial crisis. Household sector debt is also elevated compared to household incomes. As most of China’s debt is denominated in domestic currency and debts of strategic sectors are backed by the central government, we see the risk of a financial crisis as quite limited. Moreover, efforts to reduce that debt have been underway for some time. China is also attempting to curb lending outside of its banking system. In general, changing financial policy and concerns about over-indebtedness are acting as a brake on Chinese growth, a pattern that is set to continue. The trade dispute with the USA or other potential shocks pose a dilemma for China’s policymakers, as they may need to provide renewed stimulus to prevent a sharper growth slowdown. But a crisis seems unlikely. In conclusion, we believe that the potential for financial instability is lower in most countries and sectors than before the 2008 financial crisis. The exceptions are select EM where the corporate sector is more vulnerable due to fairly high levels of foreign currency debt. In the case of China and the USA, where corporate debt is also high, the exposure is largely in domestic currency and thus less risky. In the Eurozone, we note a significant improvement in the financial stability metrics, but continued political risks. Similarly, the trade conflicts are essentially political, and our base case is that the key actors will not commit serious judgement errors that would trigger significant turbulence. Finally, we flag the rise of US public sector debt as a key long-term issue. The risk is not a debt default but a decline in growth once the fiscal stimulus runs out. This could exacerbate political tensions over how to rein in debt. One option, albeit not likely, would be more deliberate pressure on the Fed to inflate away the debt, with potentially serious consequences for the stability of the Treasury market and the USD. "
Supertrends: Investing in change,"In May 2017, we took a fresh approach to equity investing, launching our five Supertrends. These long-term investment themes seem to have struck a chord with investors, adding positive value since inception. Differentiated approach. Eye on sustainability and impact.","Unsettled by financial market disruptions, investors today are looking for fresh approaches to investing. These include evolving areas such as impact investing, as well as new approaches to traditional asset classes. In May 2017, we launched our five Supertrends as an alternative way to invest in global equities. At the time, investors were already confronted with an increasingly complicated global equity investing environment with demanding valuations in certain markets and large differences in terms of performance across sectors and regions. Our view was that the successful passive equity investment trend of the quantitative easing era, such as exchange-­traded funds (ETFs) on global equity indices, would no longer deliver the same performance going forward. We developed the Supertrends with a view to investing globally in listed equities, but along very clear high conviction themes. These are based on multi-year societal trends that we believe will likely drive economic policy, company results and stock performances in a meaningful way for years to come. They cover themes ranging from population aging and the Millennials, to technological progress, the rise of a multipolar world and the upgrade of infrastructure worldwide. Within the technology theme, our investments in areas like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and healthtech, all of which have recorded double-digit returns in the past one-and-a half years, have proven to be the strongest. Infrastructure was the slowest performer, however, but should benefit from renewed catalysts in 2019 as economic policy focuses on infrastructure expenditure again. To date, Supertrends stocks or products are added to portfolios mainly to complement existing equity holdings. But as time passes and presuming the Supertrends continue to deliver the results we expect, we anticipate that investors may increasingly devote a larger share of their equity portfolios to these themes, turning them into mainstream holdings. Similarly, we find that investors increasingly seek to construct portfolios that meet environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. An increasing number of investors go even further and invest with a view to making a specific social or environmental impact. One of our Supertrends – “Millennials’ values” – already reflects this increasingly important investment trend: it only retains stocks that fulfill minimum ESG criteria. New impact investing solutions address two of the key issues of our time: healthcare and education. These solutions help provide a link between capital needs (for example students who seek a university education) and investor needs in these areas. The following pages provide more information about some of the exciting avenues Credit Suisse is pursuing as we bring impact investing into the mainstream. "
Why sustainable investing is smart,Sustainable and impact investments have seen remarkable growth. The urgent need to unlock the positive power of capital for change is best captured by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Making these objectives investable is a key trend in sustainable and impact investing. A careful approach to stock selection. Impact finance and investments make the difference. Smart investing.,"Sustainable finance and impact investing have experienced remarkable growth in recent years. Institutional investors in particular have driven global demand for sustainable investments, a market that reached USD 23 trillion in 2016, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance. There has also been a notable increase in interest and demand from other key client segments that we serve, including foundations and private wealth clients, with an exceptionally strong push from the mission-driven next generation, which we focus on as part of our Supertrends. The top investment objectives identified by sustainable and impact investors are to achieve attractive returns complemented by risk mitigation and portfolio diversification, and of course to make a difference in the world. When it comes to sustainable investments based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, companies are screened to exclude entities that are controversial or in breach of basic norms, and to promote sustainable investment by selecting entities with a best-inclass approach. Increasingly, quality data points are emerging to support these investment goals, including strong correlations between high ESG scores and financial performance, using ESG factors as a predictor of future earnings volatility, and as a defensive haven during market corrections. Measurable impact investment goes a step further and is key to addressing the large funding gap that is required to achieve the UN’s 17 SDGs. Among these goals, higher education stands out as an investment that has a deep impact because it creates a stable middle class that can support and develop the broader economy and society. In developing markets, enrolment in primary education has reached 91%, according to the UN. However, many young people are unable to continue their studies in secondary schools and even fewer at universities given the limited means of many families and financing challenges faced by governments. The creation of innovative structures in impact finance makes it possible to invest in higher education projects that yield market returns for investors. Students have access to funding at moderate rates, allowing them to attend a quality university. The quality of such loans is high: these students typically have a repayment ratio that is well above average. And the investment in securitized bonds is diversified as there are hundreds of underlying quality loans to talented students with a low correlation to capital markets. At Credit Suisse, we look back on 15 years of successful impact investing in the areas of education, financial inclusion, climate change, gender-lens investing and affordable housing. Based on this experience, we can say confidently that investing in companies and opportunities that are sustainable and impactful is simply smart investing."
Pay it forward – Impact investing and education,"Impact investing has experienced explosive growth as people seek investments which generate a financial return while creating a measurable positive social and environmental impact. This area is being aligned with the UN’s 17 SDGs, which include gender equality, clean water, zero hunger and quality primary, secondary and tertiary education. How great is the need for private initiatives in ­education? How developed is the overall impact investing market for education? What motivates someone to invest in education? What are the financial returns vs. risks in this space?  Why does Credit Suisse believe education is an attractive investment area? At Credit Suisse, we believe in the multiplier effect of investing in education.","For students in low-income countries, the hurdles to higher education can appear insurmountable. While 91% of children in developing countries are enrolled in primary school, just 1 in 12 young people will obtain secondary level skills in the least developed countries, according to UNESCO data. Many young people are unable to continue their studies in secondary schools and higher education given the limited financial means of their parents and financing challenges faced by governments. In addition, donations devoted to higher education represent just a fraction of global donations. The average person in Sierra Leone would have to work more than 100 years to pay for one year at Harvard. In an interview, Marisa Drew, Chief Executive Officer of Credit Suisse’s recently established Impact Advisory & Finance Department (IAF), discusses how investors can make a positive change in education. It is absolutely critical that the private sector step in. In a 2015 report, UNESCO estimated that the annual funding gap for education would be at least USD 39 billion between 2015 and 2030. UNESCO is calling for more and better financing to achieve the ambitious SDG goal: a quality education, for all levels of education, in all countries, regardless of gender. Today the impact investing market for education is relatively nascent compared to other SDGs like clean energy. Historically, education funding has largely rested within philanthropic circles and the non-profit sector. The 2018 Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) survey showed that only 4% of total impact investing assets under management (AuM) are dedicated to education. However, there is increasing awareness within the private sector that enormous funding gaps exist. According to GIIN, 20% of impact investors surveyed deployed capital in education in 2017 and 36% planned to increase their allocations to education in 2018. One of the biggest motivators I see for our private clients is that they benefitted from access to a quality education themselves. This is particularly true for clients who come from developing countries where universal education is a privilege, not a right. They often feel that education was their lottery ticket to a fortunate life and they want to pay it forward. A key tenet of impact investing – and this is very important for investors – is that the investment must come with a commitment to measure the impact. There are two kinds of strategies: impact investors can seek to achieve returns consistent with traditional returns for a given asset class; or they can generate concessionary returns with a portion of the return coming in the form of the impact the investment is making. The risks are the same as for traditional asset classes, although most impact investments tend to be in private markets where duration is longer and liquidity is more limited. At Credit Suisse, we believe in the multiplier effect of investing in education. The recent Goalkeepers Report* from the Gates Foundation highlighted the importance of investing in young people and especially in their education and health in order to create opportunities. If an individual’s investment in education can help reduce mortality, increase peace and security, stem the effects of climate change, lift people out of extreme poverty and foster economic prosperity – all while generating a financial return – we think the attractiveness of the investment case speaks for itself."
Positioning for late cycle growth,"As the US transitions from economic recovery and expansion to overheating, the return profile for a number of asset markets is likely to change, with key implications for investment strategy. We continue to believe that equities should outperform. The US economic cycle still matters most for global financial markets. Why the US cycle matters most? US economy remains on track. As long as the risk of US rate hikes and USD strength abates, EM equities should benefit. Brighter outlook for emerging market bonds. Equities still offer potential. As we look to 2019, our base scenario suggests that equities should remain at overweight. Chinese demand should support commodities. USD under opposing influences. Investment strategy for 2019.","Unexpected political developments had a considerable impact on financial markets in 2018, and are bound to move them in 2019 as well. Nevertheless, the economic cycle will remain the key driver of markets. The behavior of the major asset classes tends to differ considerably depending on the stage of the economic cycle. We have taken these factors into consideration in developing our base and risk scenarios for the main asset classes in 2019 and determining our investment strategy. The US economic cycle still matters most for global financial markets. While the US economy now represents slightly more than 20% of the world economy (and less than 15% adjusted for differences in purchasing power), the US equity market still constitutes 54% of the global equity market (MSCI AC World). And while the US high grade bond market, at 41%, represents a smaller share of the global bond market, US bond yields are a key driver of global asset markets, as the USD remains the largely undisputed global reserve currency. Hence, although the decisions of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) are largely driven by domestic considerations, its policies determine the price for the bulk of global liquidity. In addition, most global fixed income assets are priced based on the US Treasury curve. Given the strong influence of the US economic and rate cycle on global markets, we therefore focus on the base and risk scenarios for US interest rates as we look ahead to 2019. Our base case for the US economy in 2019 suggests that the combination of further Fed policy tightening and the fading fiscal impulse should dampen any economic overheating, and that some signs of a slowdown are likely to emerge. The main risk case would be continued strong growth and overheating. The risk of an outright contraction, in contrast, seems quite limited, at least in 2019. The main implication of our base case is a further flattening of the US yield curve. In the risk case of prolonged overheating, longer-dated yields would rise further and the curve would shift upwards. Conversely, if the economy were to slow sooner, the yield curve would invert. The key implication of an expected flattening of the US yield curve is that USD-based investors should prepare to extend duration in 2019. Meanwhile, adding inflation-protected bonds to the portfolio would provide protection against a possible protracted phase of overheating. As long as the global economy avoids a contraction in 2019, as we assume, our analysis suggests that credit should outperform Treasuries. The greater the confidence in the base case, or even an overheating scenario, the larger the warranted allocation to higher-risk bonds. Yet it is important to assess whether valuations support such exposure. At the time of writing, US high yield spreads were above 350 basis points. This seemed to provide a reasonable buffer for a robust economic scenario, but little leeway for any significant negative surprises and higher default rates. US high yield also remains exposed to idiosyncratic risks, especially energy prices. US investment grade bonds seem less attractive, however. Although cash positions of US corporations remain quite high, leverage has increased substantially since 2014 due to stock buybacks and higher investment spending. Moreover, spreads are tight by historical standards and the benchmark duration is long as corporations have until recently taken advantage of the low yield environment to issue longer-dated bonds. Hence this sub-asset class will tend to underperform Treasuries in both risk cases. A mix between Treasuries and high yield seems a better choice. As for the non-USD bond segment, emerging markets (EM) are likely to be most affected by US interest rate developments. Indeed, 2018 provided a stark reminder that tighter USD liquidity can put severe strain on EM assets. Yet if our base case materializes and pressure on the Fed to tighten policy eases, EM hard currency bonds should outperform. Insofar as a less aggressive Fed reduces pressure on EM currencies, EM local currency bonds should also do well. One of the key risks for EM local currency bonds is China: should the RMB depreciate further, other EM currencies might come under renewed pressure. Finally, bonds in other hard currency regions such as Japan, the Eurozone and Switzerland are less affected by the US economic and interest rate cycle. Domestic economic developments and monetary policy are more important. In our base case, economic growth should remain robust in these regions and monetary policy should begin to normalize. As yields in most markets remain extremely low, returns are likely to be weak or even negative in 2019. A short duration stance therefore remains warranted in these markets. In credit, senior loans still seem attractive in Europe as bank asset quality should continue to improve. However, a specific tail risk for European credit is a loss of fiscal discipline in Italy and rising concerns regarding a possible Italian exit from the EUR. In a late cycle phase, equities typically continue to outperform most asset classes. Thus, equities should still be favored unless valuations become too stretched or a contraction takes shape. That being said, the performance of different sectors may diverge substantially depending on their sensitivity to interest rates. As for investment styles, momentum stocks tend to do well late in the cycle. This should benefit large leading sectors such as IT, one of our preferred sectors at the time of writing. Similar to bonds, EM equities tend to be significantly affected by the US economic and interest rate cycle. As long as the risk of US rate hikes and USD strength abates, EM equities should benefit. That said, the influence of Asian growth is stronger for EM equities than for EM bonds due to the large weight of Chinese and other Asian equities in the MSCI EM index. Indeed, the Chinese domestic market is so large that its own business cycle has a major impact on EM equities. Our base scenario for China is a further moderate slowdown in growth, accompanied by somewhat easier monetary conditions, which would support equities. While continued robust US growth would also support Chinese and other EM equities, the risk of a further escalation of the trade conflict with the USA warrants some caution. Most equity markets in advanced economies outside of the USA – with the exception of Canada – also depend less on the US rate cycle and economy. In 2018, most developed market equity indexes lagged their US counterparts due to the low weight of technology companies within their indices and as extremely low interest rates continued to hurt financial stocks. In Europe, political risks likely added to the underperformance. But the Eurozone market may well catch up, barring a renewed crisis triggered by Italy. In this context, steady economic growth and a meaningful increase in interest rates would support financials and other domestically focused Eurozone equities. Most commodities, except for precious metals, tend to be highly cyclical assets. In most cases, they continue to do reasonably well in late cycle periods. But a significant rise in interest rates and a stronger USD tend to slow the ascent of commodity prices. Given our fairly moderate scenario for interest rates and the USD, this factor should not play a dominant role in 2019. As long as China’s all-important demand for commodities holds up, cyclical commodities should remain supported. It is challenging to predict the direction of the USD in 2019. In past late cycle phases, especially when the US yield curve inverted (i.e.markets considered monetary policy too tight), the USD would rally. Depreciation would then set in once the economy slowed and the Fed began to ease. We think it is unlikely that the Fed will tighten policy excessively in 2019. Conversely, any slightly hawkish surprise from the European Central Bank (ECB) or the Bank of Japan (BoJ) would tend to strengthen the EUR or JPY. At such a tipping point, the large US twin deficit might once again come into play and put downside pressure on the USD. As we look to 2019, our base scenario suggests that equities should remain at overweight. However, US investors should begin to lengthen bond duration. Valuations for EM bonds and currencies seem fairly attractive but China poses risks, and the same holds true for EM equities. In credit, high yield seems to offer a better risk-return trade-off than investment grade bonds. Demand for commodities should remain robust, while the factors supporting and weakening the USD are likely to be more or less in balance."
The sector standpoint,"The outlook for most sectors around the world depends on global or regional business cycles. Where leverage is high, interest rate movements will have a significant impact. Moreover, rapid technological progress continues to boost innovators and disrupt many established companies. Consumer: E-commerce is the new normal. Energy: Focus shifts to long-term growth. Financials: Structural challenges remain. Healthcare: Innovation and M&A driving growth. Industrials: Set for late cycle growth. IT: Growth cools off. Materials: Shifting production and product trends. Telecom: Strength in mobile, weakness in fixed line. Utilities: The evolution towards greener and cleaner. Real estate: Looking for new opportunities amid headwinds. ","Significant divergences characterized sector performance in 2018. The two leading growth sectors – IT and healthcare – delivered the strongest performance. No clear trend prevailed across cyclicals versus defensives. Energy was flat amid volatile oil prices, while tighter US monetary policy and the associated flattening of the US yield curve took a toll on financials. Looking to 2019, we believe that some of these trends should continue. For instance, we believe that capital expenditure during the late cycle may provide a boost for the industrials sector, while innovation and more attractive valuations could lift materials. The key question is whether IT and healthcare will again generate strong returns. While growth in most IT sectors should ease, we believe that innovations continue to make the sector attractive. In healthcare, we also see room for major advances, for example in the area of gene therapy. The consumer sector should benefit in our base scenario of continued robust growth and tight labor markets, though China and the trade dispute are key risks. In China, big ticket items, such as autos are likely to remain under pressure, while structural growth trends, such as the expanding middle class, should support luxury goods including cosmetics and high-end alcoholic beverages. Higher tariffs on China would primarily hurt US consumers. Meanwhile, e-commerce is becoming the new normal and online sales are likely to continue to grow strongly. Some incumbent retailers are successfully adapting in this area. The outlook for the energy sector is positive as earnings are likely to be boosted by rising production volumes and higher prices. Valuations have returned to fair levels. As momentum in oil prices and earnings per share (EPS) growth eventually eases, investor focus is likely to shift to longer-term growth. Investors will closely watch for possible production constraints in the Permian Basin in the USA and the shale industry, as well as the impact of such constraints on exploration and oil services companies. Tightening regulation on shipping fuels for refineries is another area of concern. Finally, investors will look out for signs of recovery in offshore drilling after prolonged weakness in that area. Growing demand for loans in most advanced economies should prove beneficial for financial stocks. In Europe, a further steepening of the yield curve in anticipation of the European Central Bank’s rate hikes should also be beneficial, while further curve flattening in the USA could act as a drag. However, national regulations, weak balance sheets and inadequate provisioning are slowing the much needed consolidation of the European banking sector. Cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are more likely in insurance, with non-life and health the preferred targets. In banks, the focus remains on cost containment rather than growth, though attractive potential dividend yields could provide a boost to the subsector. We expect to see a wave of adoption of biosimilar medicines over the coming years, supported by more aggressive leadership from the US Food and Drug Administration. This should enable large companies to invest in significant innovations, including gene therapy. Some of these therapies should become available in 2019 in the USA, including treatments that could be close to a cure for spinal muscular atrophy and hemophilia A. Fears of politically driven regulatory interventions are abating. We believe the companies that should outperform are those that lead innovation, whether developing new treatments inhouse or through tapping the small and mid-cap segment for M&A. Valuations of the industrials sector are at a cycle high, but growth in EPS and revenues should benefit if economic growth remains robust, as we expect. The capital goods subsector should be lifted by the recovery in the mining, oil and gas and industrial construction industries. The sector should also benefit from innovation in the automotive sector and further investment in robotics across industries. Earnings momentum in the semiconductor industry is likely to ease after two-and-a-half years of strong growth. This is mainly due to expanding manufacturing capacity, which puts pressure on chip prices. That said, excess capacity is limited and the correction should be fairly mild given strong underlying demand for chips from data centers and sectors such as communication. The internet and software industries should benefit as companies shift to areas such as cloud infrastructure, business process digitalization and hyper-scale data centers. The IT hardware sector might see a slowdown in PC demand, with growth in the smartphone market expected to decline to a low single-digit rate despite innovations such as foldable screens, augmented reality services and 5G networks. In steel, we expect production to keep improving on the back of strong demand. Environmental concerns in China should boost demand for higher-quality iron ore to reduce pollution. As China takes capacity out of the market and shifts to higher-quality iron ore, the global supply for steel should remain balanced in 2019. In the chemicals sector, China is shifting from coal to gas as a raw material input. Mining companies should continue to return capital to shareholders by paying attractive dividends and buying back shares. We see strong themes continuing in chemicals, including the evolution of battery technology for electric vehicles and the migration from plastics to biodegradable products. A potential slowdown in China is the key risk for the sector given that market’s dominance. Differences between individual markets are likely to remain significant in the telecom sector. In the USA, we expect wireless market trends to improve thanks to new 5G offerings. In Europe, the regulatory environment is improving. With a separation of network and services now possible, shares of network companies may rerate. Attractive potential dividends and historically low relative valuations should attract investors, especially if growth optimism diminishes. In Japan, competition is set to intensify as a fourth operator has entered the market. In China, consolidation is on the horizon because the investments for 5G networks are too high for companies to finance on their own. Pressure from governments worldwide to roll out 5G networks and initiatives in areas such as the Internet of Things could decide the sector’s fate. Rising interest rates could put further pressure on the valuations of regulated utility companies, especially in Europe. Regulated utilities also have to digest new tariffs for regulated returns in Spain and the UK. In addition, investors will focus on the ongoing shift towards renewables in electricity generation portfolios as costs are falling to competitive levels. Thermal power producers are benefiting from nuclear power plant closures in Germany and Belgium as well as expected coal plant closures across several countries. Another area of focus is the recent spike in EU carbon prices. If this trend continues, it would support another increase in power prices and generate windfall profits for clean electricity generators. The real estate sector is influenced by two opposing factors. Economic growth and rising yields (associated with growth). In that sense, 2018 was a difficult year for listed real estate as US interest rates moved up significantly. Looking ahead, 2019 is likely to bring more volatility. Though economic growth remains supportive, a further normalization in global monetary policy is a headwind. In addition, pricing in commercial real estate markets looks increasingly stretched, especially in the USA. As the cycle becomes more mature, investors have to be more selective and look to opportunities beyond traditional core strategies. One example is logistics real estate, which benefits from the continued expansion of e-commerce; or assisted living and healthcare facilities to cater to the needs of an aging population. "
The state of play for currencies,"Investing in foreign currencies does not usually generate excess returns compared with holding domestic cash. When currencies are clearly undervalued, however, it can be worth taking such positions. Conversely, holding low yielding safe-haven currencies pays off when risks spike significantly. Political twists in the road. EM currencies look more attractive.","Currency markets provided a number of surprises in 2018. Forecasts generally assumed that the major currencies would be able to build on their gains in 2017 against the USD. Yet the stronger-than-expected growth momentum in the USA prevented them from doing so. In response to strong growth, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) continued to raise rates while the central banks of other advanced economies retained a dovish stance. The interest rate or carry advantage (positive difference in interest rates between two currencies) for the USD thus increased. Furthermore, the worsening US twin deficit did not weaken the USD. Looking ahead to 2019, we believe that a further surge of the USD is unlikely. While US growth is likely to remain higher than in other advanced economies, the gap should narrow. As for US central bank rates, they will remain significantly higher than in other advanced economies, with the gap likely to even widen until mid-2019. If growth and inflation continue to pick up outside the US, non-US central banks may, however, start tightening sooner. Finally, our valuation screen shows a moderate USD overvaluation against the other major currencies. It is hard to tell whether the twin deficit might re-emerge as a risk factor for the USD. This would most likely happen if US economic growth slowed markedly, a development we consider unlikely in 2019. As for emerging market (EM) currencies, we sense a bigger shift in fundamentals: policymakers in many EM were forced to raise interest rates as their currencies came under pressure in 2018. As a result, the carry between EM currencies and the USD has increased, in some cases substantially. At the same time, the valuations of a number of currencies have become more attractive. This suggests that both carry and valuation-based strategies may once more be effective assuming fundamentals stay constructive. Specifically, currencies will only appreciate if the external balance of the respective country stabilizes. Progress on rebalancing should therefore be watched carefully. Political twists in the road In 2018, political events also impacted certain currencies. The escalating trade tensions between the USA and China depressed the RMB, while the close economic links of Japan and China may have prevented the attractively valued JPY from appreciating. In Europe, worries over Italian fiscal policy temporarily boosted the CHF, while the GBP swung back and forth with every twist in the road leading to Brexit. Looking to 2019, we do not think that the US-China trade conflict will be resolved quickly. As a result, the RMB may remain under pressure. Insofar as the Chinese authorities continue to ease monetary policy, this trend is set to persist. Yet we believe that China will proceed cautiously to avoid triggering investor uncertainty and capital outflows. As regards the conflict over the budget deficit between Italy and the European Union, we believe it is quite unlikely that the European Central Bank will give in to Italian political pressure. Hence the EUR currency pairs should be little affected by these tensions. Meanwhile, valuation remains highly supportive of the GBP, implying that a soft Brexit may well help close the valuation discount. Conversely, a hard Brexit and its ensuing chaos would intensify pressure on the GBP. EM currencies look more attractive The developments of the past year appear to have produced a situation in which value and carry overlap for a number of currencies. Investors may thus be able to generate excess returns after a disappointing 2018. Among the advanced economy currencies, the GBP, NOK and SEK looked clearly attractive based on our valuation screen as we went to press. Among EM currencies, the TRY and MXN seemed attractive. The NZD and CHF appeared expensive, while the only EM currency that looked expensive was the THB. In terms of carry, two EM currencies, the BRL and TRY, looked attractive. Overall, our expectation of a fairly benign inflation picture in EM and a very wide real rate differential relative to developed markets, including the USD, suggests that other EM currencies may also outperform the USD. Meanwhile, some of the traditional advanced economy carry currencies, in particular the AUD, have lost appeal in the wake of Fed tightening. Among the safe haven currencies, the valuation divergence between the somewhat overvalued CHF and the undervalued JPY should close, especially if trade war concerns abate. In conclusion, investors who hold large amounts of cash in low-yielding currencies (i.e. the CHF and EUR) that trade within their fair value band should be able to enhance returns by taking positions in some of the value or carry currencies described above. For USD-based investors, there is less incentive to take such positions as US cash returns are higher. That said, with the USD somewhat overvalued and the twin deficit making a possible comeback as a risk factor, limited diversification might improve portfolio performance as well. "
Theme 1: Interest rate normalization,"Low yields make credit unattractive. Equities, commodities tend to outperform. Opportunities for active managers.","The cycle is at an advanced stage, but recession is still not imminent and central banks continue to normalize interest rates. Against this backdrop, investors inevitably wonder how to invest. We favor keeping a growth tilt in portfolios. This means focusing on assets that have consistently outperformed during the later phase of past expansions, while reducing market exposure by diversifying into more uncorrelated sources of return. What can we observe from past cycles? On average, US bond yields have risen and the curve has flattened in the later stages of expansions. However, it is important to divide this into pre-Volcker shock (i.e.before the US Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate to 20% in 1981) and post. Bond yields began trending higher along with inflation in the early 1950s, peaked in 1981, and then trended lower until 2012. This is important because any cycle analysis of bonds will mostly be driven by whether the longer-term trend in yields was up or down. Low yields make credit unattractive Whether yields behave like the post-1981 era or the 1950s to 1980s period depends on the inflation outlook. For now, we do not believe inflation is likely to break out of its 25-year range, and thus the extent to which bonds can enter a bear market is limited. This does not mean yields cannot rise; it just means the terminal federal funds rate is likely to once again be lower than in the previous economic cycle. Additionally, today’s low level of yields and very flat curve make it very difficult to obtain a positive return on bonds, especially outside the USA. Elsewhere in fixed income, one of the more consistent patterns we can observe from past cycles is that credit spreads tend to tighten early in the cycle, trough around three quarters of the way through the expansion, and then widen in the latter phase. Given the low level of yields this time around, credit seems quite an unattractive late cycle investment. Equities, commodities tend to outperform As one would expect, equities tend to rally strongly in the later stage of the expansion. Within equities, small caps have underperformed large caps and cyclicals have quite consistently outperformed defensives. The USD has on average depreciated in the latter third of past expansions but there is a lot of variation across cycles, so this is far from certain. In contrast, commodities and especially gold have tended to appreciate consistently. Opportunities for active managers In summary, reducing market exposure should be intuitive given the exceptional bull market in this cycle. Additionally, tightening monetary policy and high valuations mean that forward-looking returns are likely lower than they have been. All these factors should benefit active managers. Alpha (uncorrelated returns) has been in short supply this cycle. High cross-market correlations and low macro volatility have made it very difficult to add value without beta (market) exposure. Going forward, volatility is likely to be higher, correlations are likely to be lower, and divergences between economies and assets more pronounced. Reducing beta can be achieved by adding exposure to absolute return strategies that aim to be uncorrelated across market environments. Actively managed hedging strategies can also help mitigate risk, while reducing the drag on returns compared to other hedges like buying put options."
Theme 2: Regional economic divergence,Central bank policy in focus. Wages on the rise. Current accounts make the difference.,"Differences in the relative strength of labor markets and economic growth between countries have led to large divergences in global monetary policy, driving growing interest rate differentials and large currency moves. This has incentivized capital to flow into the USA, pushing the USD higher, but has also exposed weaknesses in emerging markets (EM) with large imbalances, like Argentina and Turkey. This helped drive further capital into US assets, creating a vicious cycle for EM. For investors, it is important to look for large divergences between fundamentals and prices in order to find attractive investment opportunities. Central bank policy in focus Monetary policy tightening cycles tend to flatten yield curves. Given that the Federal Reserve (Fed) continues to tighten monetary policy, the recent US curve flattening should continue. And as Eurozone growth starts to catch up and the European Central Bank becomes more hawkish, the Euro rate curve should also flatten. In contrast, the Bank of Japan has implemented a yield curve control policy that has capped the level of 10-year yields, hence any pullback in accommodation will likely have the opposite effect of steepening the curve. Wages on the rise In equity markets, there is a trade-off between higher wages and interest rates hurting margins and the higher growth that comes with it that could offset the negative impact of rising costs. Countries that provide more fiscal support and sectors that are less exposed to the impact of higher wages and rates because they are less capital and labor intensive or have lower leverage should also outperform. Current accounts make the difference There are also a number of divergences in EM that will likely persist over the coming year. Current account surplus economies should be less vulnerable, while current account deficit countries should be more vulnerable. If the capex cycle in developed markets (DM) continues to pick up steam, this contrast should become even larger, as surplus economies would benefit from a large rise in DM imports. If global growth slows down, most surplus countries should be able to pursue counter-cyclical measures, whereas deficit countries would likely face a worsening growthinflation trade-off. Trade tensions are also important, and we think they are likely to remain elevated between the USA and China. Yet China will use a combination of stimulus and currency depreciation to offset any real impact on growth. It is important to look for large divergences between fundamentals and prices in order to find attractive investment opportunities. This means that in some cases, where prices have moved very far from fundamentals, it may make sense to own current account deficit countries or to sell current account surplus countries. The election in Brazil has created volatility, which we think is unwarranted. Russia should benefit from the increase in oil prices and has some of the strongest fundamentals and most credible economic policymaking in EM. Israel has a strong balance of payments and a healthy economic outlook. However, South Korea is highly exposed to trade and globalization and is struggling to transition to a more domestically focused economy. South Africa has growing external debt and a widening deficit. It is also subject to a lack of structural reforms and ongoing political uncertainty. Combined, these factors make it one of the countries more exposed to external risks."
Theme 3: New geopolitical regimes,The rise of populism. Trade and inflation pose risks. Demographic shifts.,"The last 40 years have seen increasing globalization and free trade, deregulation and a focus on reducing the role of the state in society. These policies created three decades of strong global growth, which was accompanied by moderate inflation, low macroeconomic volatility and ever more integrated global markets. The rise of populism With the positives came unintended consequences: boom and bust cycles; a sharp fall in the bargaining power of labor; and rising inequality. This inequality was driven by a decline in real wages for mostly blue collar workers, who now had to compete with lower cost offshore centers. This meant communities that depended on those jobs saw declining standards of living and rising unemployment and crime, further compounding the sense of being left behind. The response of policymakers to recent crises helped support one of the largest bull markets on record, again helping the owners of capital and creating a recovery perceived to have benefited the few at the expense of the many. Immigration has given disillusioned voters an easy target for their anger and a focus for opportunistic politicians and ideologues. All of this has led to the rise of populism, which is likely to gather further momentum. Trade and inflation pose risks So what are the implications for markets? First we should assume that the current tensions between the USA and China will continue, but any economic impact would likely be offset by Chinese fiscal stimulus. Beyond trade, the main risk we see is around inflation. Investors have been conditioned to believe that inflation cannot rise meaningfully and thus neither can bond yields. But this has been a unique period in history and current populists, if left to their own devices, would clearly pursue policies that would reverse many of the disinflationary forces of the past 30 years. Combined with high debt levels and an unsustainable fiscal trajectory, this creates a key risk. To be clear, we are not forecasting such a scenario. We are simply pointing out an asymmetry of market pricing. A rise in global inflation expectations to levels that were normal before 2007 would likely result in a material repricing of asset markets. Were such a risk to materialize, it is likely that the bond/ equity correlation would reverse, which would reduce diversification in portfolios, and real assets like commodities and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) would benefit. To be clear, we are not likely close to a real inflation shock, and it would probably need a severe economic slowdown to happen. However, buying cheap inflation protection when it is available makes sense. As populists favor fiscal expansion, the equity markets of countries most able to provide this stimulus should outperform, which at present means the USA and China. China is clearly not populist, but the government has the ability and willingness to use fiscal stimulus, which is also its main defense against US trade tariffs. We favor being short duration government bonds in the Eurozone vs.the USA. Demographic shifts In addition, population aging is continuing, and the baby boomers will soon start focusing their spending mostly on healthcare. This will be a drag on growth and a strain on healthcare and social security programs, and will have to become a key focus of policymakers and a further challenge to the fiscal situation. We suggest owning select parts of the healthcare sector, which should benefit from increased demand as the baby boomers age, as well as parts of the tech sector that aim to automate and lower costs in healthcare as well as improve the patient experience in old age. Our Silver Economy Supertrend is a good way to position for this shift."
