"In a much quoted passage in his inaugural address, President Kennedy  said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your  country."" It is a striking sign of the temper of our times that the controversy  about this passage centered on its origin and not on its content. Neither half of  the statement expresses a relation between the citizen and his government that  is worthy of the ideals of free men in a free society. The paternalistic ""what your  country can do for you"" implies that government is the patron, the citizen the  ward, a view that is at odds with the free man's belief in his own responsibility  for his own destiny. The organismic, ""what you can do for your country"" implies  that government is the master or the deity, the citizen, the servant or the votary.  To the free man, the country is the collection of individuals who compose it, not  something over and above them. He is proud of a common heritage and loyal to  common traditions. But he regards government as a means, an instrumentality,  neither a grantor of favors and gifts, nor a master or god to be blindly  worshipped and served. He recognizes no national goal except as it is the  consensus of the goals that the citizens severally serve. He recognizes no  national purpose except as it is the consensus of the purposes for which the  citizens severally strive.   The free man will ask neither what his country can do for him nor what he  can do for his country. He will ask rather ""What can I and my compatriots do  through government"" to help us discharge our individual responsibilities, to  achieve our several goals and purposes, and above all, to protect our freedom?  And he will accompany this question with another: How can we keep the  government we create from becoming a Frankenstein that will destroy the very  freedom we establish it to protect? Freedom is a rare and delicate plant. Our  minds tell us, and history confirms, that the great threat to freedom is the  concentration of power. Government is necessary to preserve our freedom, it is  an instrument through which we can exercise our freedom; yet by concentrating  power in political hands, it is also a threat to freedom. Even though the men who  wield this power initially be of good will and even though they be not corrupted  by the power they exercise, the power will both attract and form men of a  different stamp.   How can we benefit from the promise of government while avoiding the  threat to freedom? Two broad principles embodied in our Constitution give an  answer that has preserved our freedom so far, though they have been violated  repeatedly in practice while proclaimed as precept.   First, the scope of government must be limited. Its major function must  be to protect our freedom both from the enemies outside our gates and from our  fellow-citizens: to preserve law and order, to enforce private contracts, to foster competitive markets. Beyond this major function, government may enable us at  times to accomplish jointly what we would find it more difficult or expensive to  accomplish severally. However, any such use of government is fraught with  danger. We should not and cannot avoid using government in this way. But there  should be a clear and large balance of advantages before we do. By relying  primarily on voluntary co-operation and private enterprise, in both economic and  other activities, we can insure that the private sector is a check on the powers of  the governmental sector and an effective protection of freedom of speech, of  religion, and of thought.   The second broad principle is that government power must be dispersed.  If government is to exercise power, better in the county than in the state, better  in the state than in Washington. If I do not like what my local community does,  be it in sewage disposal, or zoning, or schools, I can move to another local  community, and though few may take this step, the mere possibility acts as a  check. If I do not like what my state does, I can move to another. If I do not like  what Washington imposes, I have few alternatives in this world of jealous  nations.   The very difficulty of avoiding the enactments of the federal government  is of course the great attraction of centralization to many of its proponents. It  will enable them more effectively, they believe, to legislate programs that as they  see it are in the interest of the public, whether it be the transfer of income from  the rich to the poor or from private to governmental purposes. They are in a  sense right. But this coin has two sides. The power to do good is also the power  to do harm; those who control the power today may not tomorrow; and, more  important, what one man regards as good, another may regard as harm. The  great tragedy of the drive to centralization, as of the drive to extend the scope of  government in general, is that it is mostly led by men of good will who will be  the first to rue its consequences.   The preservation of freedom is the protective reason for limiting and  decentralizing governmental power. But there is also a constructive reason. The  great advances of civilization, whether in architecture or painting, in science or  literature, in industry or agriculture, have never come from centralized  government. Columbus did not set out to seek a new route to China in response  to a majority directive of a parliament, though he was partly financed by an  absolute monarch. Newton and Leibnitz; Einstein and Bohr; Shakespeare, Milton,  and Pasternak; Whitney, McCormick, Edison, and Ford; Jane Addams, Florence  Nightingale, and Albert Schweitzer; no one of these opened new frontiers in  human knowledge and understanding, in literature, in technical possibilities, or in  the relief of human misery in response to governmental directives. Their  achievements were the product of individual genius, of strongly held minority  views, of a social climate permitting variety and diversity. Government can never duplicate the variety and diversity of individual  action. At any moment in time, by imposing uniform standards in housing, or  nutrition, or clothing, government could undoubtedly improve the level of living  of many individuals; by imposing uniform standards in schooling, road  construction, or sanitation, central government could undoubtedly improve the  level of performance in many local areas and perhaps even on the average of all  communities. But in the process, government would replace progress by  stagnation, it would substitute uniform mediocrity for the variety essential for  that experimentation which can bring tomorrow's laggards above today's mean.    This book discusses some of these great issues. Its major theme is the  role of competitive capitalism the organization of the bulk of economic activity  through private enterprise operating in a free market as a system of economic  freedom and a necessary condition for political freedom. Its minor theme is the  role that government should play in a society dedicated to freedom and relying  primarily on the market to organize economic activity.   The first two chapters deal with these issues on an abstract level, in terms  of principles rather than concrete application. The later chapters apply these  principles to a variety of particular problems.   An abstract statement can conceivably be complete and exhaustive,  though this ideal is certainly far from realized in the two chapters that follow.  The application of the principles cannot even conceivably be exhaustive. Each  day brings new problems and new circumstances. That is why the role of the  state can never be spelled out once and for all in terms of specific functions. It is  also why we need from time to time to re-examine the bearing of what we hope  are unchanged principles on the problems of the day. A by-product is inevitably a  retesting of the principles and a sharpening of our understanding of them.   It is extremely convenient to have a label for the political and economic  viewpoint elaborated in this book. The rightful and proper label is liberalism.  Unfortunately, ""As a supreme, if unintended compliment, the enemies of the  system of private enterprise have thought it wise to appropriate its label"", 1 so  that liberalism has, in the United States, come to have a very different meaning  than it did in the nineteenth century or does today over much of the Continent of  Europe.   As it developed in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the  intellectual movement that went under the name of liberalism emphasized  freedom as the ultimate goal and the individual as the ultimate entity in the  society. It supported laissez faire at home as a means of reducing the role of the state in economic affairs and thereby enlarging the role of the individual; it  supported free trade abroad as a means of linking the nations of the world  together peacefully and democratically. In political matters, it supported the  development of representative government and of parliamentary institutions,  reduction in the arbitrary power of the state, and protection of the civil freedoms  of individuals.   Beginning in the late nineteenth century, and especially after 1930 in the  United States, the term liberalism came to be associated with a very different  emphasis, particularly in economic policy. It came to be associated with a  readiness to rely primarily on the state rather than on private voluntary  arrangements to achieve objectives regarded as desirable. The catchwords  became welfare and equality rather than freedom. The nineteenth-century liberal  regarded an extension of freedom as the most effective way to promote welfare  and equality; the twentieth-century liberal regards welfare and equality as either  prerequisites of or alternatives to freedom. In the name of welfare and equality,  the twentieth-century liberal has come to favor a revival of the very policies of  state intervention and paternalism against which classical liberalism fought. In  the very act of turning the clock back to seventeenth-century mercantilism, he is  fond of castigating true liberals as reactionary!   The change in the meaning attached to the term liberalism is more  striking in economic matters than in political. The twentieth-century liberal, like  the nineteenth-century liberal, favors parliamentary institutions, representative  government, civil rights, and so on. Yet even in political matters, there is a  notable difference. Jealous of liberty, and hence fearful of centralized power,  whether in governmental or private hands, the nineteenth-century liberal favored  political decentralization. Committed to action and confident of the beneficence  of power so long as it is in the hands of a government ostensibly controlled by  the electorate, the twentieth-century liberal favors centralized government. He  will resolve any doubt about where power should be located in favor of the state  instead of the city, of the federal government instead of the state, and of a world  organization instead of a national government.   Because of the corruption of the term liberalism, the views that formerly  went under that name are now often labeled conservatism. But this is not a  satisfactory alternative. The nineteenth-century liberal was a radical, both in the  etymological sense of going to the root of the matter, and in the political sense  of favoring major changes in social institutions. So too must be his modern heir.  We do not wish to conserve the state interventions that have interfered so  greatly with our freedom, though, of course, we do wish to conserve those that  have promoted it, Moreover, in practice, the term conservatism has come to  cover so wide a range of views, and views so incompatible with one another, that we shall no doubt see the growth of hyphenated designations, such as  libertarian-conservative and arisTOCratic-conservative.   Partly because of my reluctance to surrender the term to proponents of  measures that would destroy liberty, partly because I cannot find a better  alternative, I shall resolve these difficulties by using the word liberalism in its  original sense as the doctrines pertaining to a free man. ",Capitalism and Freedom  Introduction,"The introduction lays out the principles of Friedman's archetypal liberal, a man who supports limited and dispersed governmental power. Friedman opts for the continental European, rather than American, definition of the term."
"It is widely believed that politics and economics are separate and largely  unconnected; that individual freedom is a political problem and material welfare  an economic problem; and that any kind of political arrangements can be  combined with any kind of economic arrangements. The chief contemporary  manifestation of this idea is the advocacy of ""democratic socialism"" by many who  condemn out of hand the restrictions on individual freedom imposed by  ""totalitarian socialism"" in Russia, and who are persuaded that it is possible for a  country to adopt the essential features of Russian economic arrangements and  yet to ensure individual freedom through political arrangements. The thesis  of this chapter is that such a view is a delusion, that there is an intimate  connection between economics and politics, that only certain combinations of  political and economic arrangements are possible, and that in particular, a  society which is socialist cannot also be democratic, in the sense of guaranteeing  individual freedom.   Economic arrangements play a dual role in the promotion of a free  society. On the one hand, freedom in economic arrangements is itself a  component of freedom broadly understood, so economic freedom is an end in  itself. In the second place, economic freedom is also an indispensable means  toward the achievement of political freedom.   The first of these roles of economic freedom needs special emphasis  because intellectuals in particular have a strong bias against regarding this  aspect of freedom as important. They tend to express contempt for what they  regard as material aspects of life, and to regard their own pursuit of allegedly  higher values as on a different plane of significance and as deserving of special  attention. For most citizens of the country, however, if not for the intellectual,  the direct importance of economic freedom is at least comparable in significance  to the indirect importance of economic freedom as a means to political freedom.   The citizen of Great Britain, who after World War II was not permitted to  spend his vacation in the United States because of exchange control, was being  deprived of an essential freedom no less than the citizen of the United States,  who was denied the opportunity to spend his vacation in Russia because of his  political views. The one was ostensibly an economic limitation on freedom and  the other a political limitation, yet there is no essential difference between the  two.    15     The citizen of the United States who is compelled by law to devote  something like 10 per cent of his income to the purchase of a particular kind of  retirement contract, administered by the government, is being deprived of a  corresponding part of his personal freedom. How strongly this deprivation may  be felt and its closeness to the deprivation of religious freedom, which all would  regard as ""civil"" or ""political"" rather than ""economic"", were dramatized by an  episode involving a group of farmers of the Amish sect. On grounds of principle,  this group regarded compulsory federal old age programs as an infringement of  their personal individual freedom and refused to pay taxes or accept benefits. As  a result, some of their livestock were sold by auction in order to satisfy claims for  social security levies. True, the number of citizens who regard compulsory old  age insurance as a deprivation of freedom may be few, but the believer in  freedom has never counted noses.   A citizen of the United States who under the laws of various states is not  free to follow the occupation of his own choosing unless he can get a license for  it, is likewise being deprived of an essential part of his freedom. So is the man  who would like to exchange some of his goods with, say, a Swiss for a watch but  is prevented from doing so by a quota. So also is the Californian who was thrown  into jail for selling Alka Seltzer at a price below that set by the manufacturer  under so-called ""fair trade"" laws. So also is the farmer who cannot grow the  amount of wheat he wants. And so on. Clearly, economic freedom, in and of  itself, is an extremely important part of total freedom.   Viewed as a means to the end of political freedom, economic  arrangements are important because of their effect on the concentration or  dispersion of power. The kind of economic organization that provides economic  freedom directly, namely, competitive capitalism, also promotes political freedom  because it separates economic power from political power and in this way  enables the one to offset the other.   Historical evidence speaks with a single voice on the relation between  political freedom and a free market. I know of no example in time or place of a  society that has been marked by a large measure of political freedom, and that  has not also used something comparable to a free market to organize the bulk of  economic activity.   Because we live in a largely free society, we tend to forget how limited is  the span of time and the part of the globe for which there has ever been  anything like political freedom: the typical state of mankind is tyranny, servitude,  and misery. The nineteenth century and early twentieth century in the Western  world stand out as striking exceptions to the general trend of historical  development. Political freedom in this instance clearly came along with the free    16     market and the development of capitalist institutions. So also did political  freedom in the golden age of Greece and in the early days of the Roman era.   History suggests only that capitalism is a necessary condition for political  freedom. Clearly it is not a sufficient condition. Fascist Italy and Fascist Spain,  Germany at various times in the last seventy years, Japan before World Wars I  and II, tzarist Russia in the decades before World War I are all societies that  cannot conceivably be described as politically free. Yet, in each, private  enterprise was the dominant form of economic organization. It is therefore  clearly possible to have economic arrangements that are fundamentally capitalist  and political arrangements that are not free.   Even in those societies, the citizenry had a good deal more freedom than  citizens of a modern totalitarian state like Russia or Nazi Germany, in which  economic totalitarianism is combined with political totalitarianism. Even in Russia  under the Tzars, it was possible for some citizens, under some circumstances, to  change their jobs without getting permission from political authority because  capitalism and the existence of private property provided some check to the  centralized power of the state.   The relation between political and economic freedom is complex and by  no means unilateral. In the early nineteenth century, Bentham and the  Philosophical Radicals were inclined to regard political freedom as a means to  economic freedom. They believed that the masses were being hampered by the  restrictions that were being imposed upon them, and that if political reform gave  the bulk of the people the vote, they would do what was good for them, which  was to vote for laissez faire. In retrospect, one cannot say that they were wrong.  There was a large measure of political reform that was accompanied by  economic reform in the direction of a great deal of laissez faire. An enormous  increase in the well-being of the masses followed this change in economic  arrangements.   The triumph of Benthamite liberalism in nineteenth-century England was  followed by a reaction toward increasing intervention by government in economic  affairs. This tendency to collectivism was greatly accelerated, both in England  and elsewhere, by the two World Wars. Welfare rather than freedom became the  dominant note in democratic countries. Recognizing the implicit threat to  individualism, the intellectual descendants of the Philosophical Radicals Dicey,  Mises, Hayek, and Simons, to mention only a few feared that a continued  movement toward centralized control of economic activity would prove The Road  to Serfdom, as Hayek entitled his penetrating analysis of the process. Their  emphasis was on economic freedom as a means toward political freedom.    17     Events since the end of World War II display still a different relation  between economic and political freedom. Collectivist economic planning has  indeed interfered with individual freedom. At least in some countries, however,  the result has not been the suppression of freedom, but the reversal of economic  policy. England again provides the most striking example. The turning point was  perhaps the ""control of engagements"" order which, despite great misgivings, the  Labour party found it necessary to impose in order to carry out its economic  policy. Fully enforced and carried through, the law would have involved  centralized allocation of individuals to occupations. This conflicted so sharply with  personal liberty that it was enforced in a negligible number of cases, and then  repealed after the law had been in effect for only a short period. Its repeal  ushered in a decided shift in economic policy, marked by reduced reliance on  centralized ""plans"" and ""programs"", by the dismantling of many controls, and by  increased emphasis on the private market. A similar shift in policy occurred in  most other democratic countries.   The proximate explanation of these shifts in policy is the limited success  of central planning or its outright failure to achieve stated objectives. However,  this failure is itself to be attributed, at least in some measure, to the political  implications of central planning and to an unwillingness to follow out its logic  when doing so requires trampling rough-shod on treasured private rights. It may  well be that the shift is only a temporary interruption in the collectivist trend of  this century. Even so, it illustrates the close relation between political freedom  and economic arrangements.   Historical evidence by itself can never be convincing. Perhaps it was sheer  coincidence that the expansion of freedom occurred at the same time as the  development of capitalist and market institutions. Why should there be a  connection? What are the logical links between economic and political freedom?  In discussing these questions we shall consider first the market as a direct  component of freedom, and then the indirect relation between market  arrangements and political freedom. A by-product will be an outline of the ideal  economic arrangements for a free society.   As liberals, we take freedom of the individual, or perhaps the family, as  our ultimate goal in judging social arrangements. Freedom as a value in this  sense has to do with the interrelations among people; it has no meaning  whatsoever to a Robinson Crusoe on an isolated island (without his Man Friday).  Robinson Crusoe on his island is subject to ""constraint,"" he has limited ""power,""  and he has only a limited number of alternatives, but there is no problem of  freedom in the sense that is relevant to our discussion. Similarly, in a society  freedom has nothing to say about what an individual does with his freedom; it is  not an all-embracing ethic. Indeed, a major aim of the liberal is to leave the  ethical problem for the individual to wrestle with. The ""really"" important ethical    18     problems are those that face an individual in a free society what he should do  with his freedom. There are thus two sets of values that a liberal will emphasize  the values that are relevant to relations among people, which is the context in  which he assigns first priority to freedom; and the values that are relevant to the  individual in the exercise of his freedom, which is the realm of individual ethics  and philosophy.   The liberal conceives of men as imperfect beings. He regards the problem  of social organization to be as much a negative problem of preventing ""bad""  people from doing harm as of enabling ""good"" people to do good; and, of  course, ""bad"" and ""good"" people may be the same people, depending on who is  judging them.   The basic problem of social organization is how to co-ordinate the  economic activities of large numbers of people. Even in relatively backward  societies, extensive division of labor and specialization of function is required to  make effective use of available resources. In advanced societies, the scale on  which coordination is needed, to take full advantage of the opportunities offered  by modern science and technology, is enormously greater. Literally millions of  people are involved in providing one another with their daily bread, let alone with  their yearly automobiles. The challenge to the believer in liberty is to reconcile  this widespread interdependence with individual freedom.   Fundamentally, there are only two ways of co-ordinating the economic  activities of millions. One is central direction involving the use of coercion the  technique of the army and of the modern totalitarian state. The other is  voluntary co-operation of individuals the technique of the market place.   The possibility of co-ordination through voluntary co-operation rests on  the elementary yet frequently denied proposition that both parties to an  economic transaction benefit from it, provided the transaction is bi-laterally  voluntary and informed.   Exchange can therefore bring about co-ordination without coercion. A  working model of a society organized through voluntary exchange is a free  private enterprise exchange economy what we have been calling competitive  capitalism.   In its simplest form, such a society consists of a number of independent  households a collection of Robinson Crusoes, as it were. Each household uses  the resources it controls to produce goods and services that it exchanges for  goods and services produced by other households, on terms mutually acceptable  to the two parties to the bargain. It is thereby enabled to satisfy its wants  indirectly by producing goods and services for others, rather than directly by    19     producing goods for its own immediate use. The incentive for adopting this  indirect route is, of course, the increased product made possible by division of  labor and specialization of function. Since the household always has the  alternative of producing directly for itself, it need not enter into any exchange  unless it benefits from it. Hence, no exchange will take place unless both parties  do benefit from it. Co-operation is thereby achieved without coercion.   Specialization of function and division of labor would not go far if the  ultimate productive unit were the household. In a modern society, we have gone  much farther. We have introduced enterprises which are intermediaries between  individuals in their capacities as suppliers of service and as purchasers of goods.  And similarly, specialization of function and division of labor could not go very far  if we had to continue to rely on the barter of product for product. In  consequence, money has been introduced as a means of facilitating exchange,  and of enabling the acts of purchase and of sale to be separated into two parts.   Despite the important role of enterprises and of money in our actual  economy, and despite the numerous and complex problems they raise, the  central characteristic of the market technique of achieving co-ordination is fully  displayed in the simple exchange economy that contains neither enterprises nor  money. As in that simple model, so in the complex enterprise and money-  exchange economy, co-operation is strictly individual and voluntary provided: (a)  that enterprises are private, so that the ultimate contracting parties are  individuals and (b) that individuals arc effectively free to enter or not to enter  into any particular exchange, so that every transaction is strictly voluntary.   It is far easier to state these provisos in general terms than to spell them  out in detail, or to specify precisely the institutional arrangements most  conducive to their maintenance. Indeed, much of technical economic literature is  concerned with precisely these questions. The basic requisite is the maintenance  of law and order to prevent physical coercion of one individual by another and to  enforce contracts voluntarily entere
 into, thus giving substance to ""private"".  Aside from this, perhaps the most difficult problems arise from monopoly which  inhibits effective freedom by denying individuals alternatives to the particular  exchange and from ""neighborhood effects"" effects on third parties for which it is  not feasible to charge or recompense them. These problems will be discussed in  more detail in the following chapter.   So long as effective freedom of exchange is maintained, the central  feature of the market organization of economic activity is that it prevents one  person from interfering with another in respect of most of his activities. The  consumer is protected from coercion by the seller because of the presence of  other sellers with whom he can deal. The seller is protected from coercion by the  consumer because of other consumers to whom he can sell. The employee is    20     protected from coercion by the employer because of other employers for whom  he can work, and so on. And the market does this impersonally and without  centralized authority.   Indeed, a major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that it  does this task so well. It gives people what they want instead of what a  particular group thinks they ought to want. Underlying most arguments against  the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.   The existence of a free market does not of course eliminate the need for  government. On the contrary, government is essential both as a forum for  determining the ""rules of the game"" and as an umpire to interpret and enforce  the rules decided on. What the market does is to reduce greatly the range of  issues that must be decided through political means, and thereby to minimize the  extent to which government need participate directly in the game. The  characteristic feature of action through political channels is that it tends to  require or enforce substantial conformity. The great advantage of the market, on  the other hand, is that it permits wide diversity. It is, in political terms, a system  of proportional representation. Each man can vote, as it were, for the color of tie  he wants and get it; he does not have to see what color the majority wants and  then, if he is in the minority, submit.   It is this feature of the market that we refer to when we say that the  market provides economic freedom. But this characteristic also has implications  that go far beyond the narrowly economic. Political freedom means the absence  of coercion of a man by his fellow men. The fundamental threat to freedom is  power to coerce, be it in the hands of a monarch, a dictator, an oligarchy, or a  momentary majority. The preservation of freedom requires the elimination of  such concentration of power to the fullest possible extent and the dispersal and  distribution of whatever power cannot be eliminated a system of checks and  balances. By removing the organization of economic activity from the control of  political authority, the market eliminates this source of coercive power. It enables  economic strength to be a check to political power rather than a reinforcement.   Economic power can be widely dispersed. There is no law of conservation  which forces the growth of new centers of economic strength to be at the  expense of existing centers. Political power, on the other hand, is more difficult  to decentralize. There can be numerous small independent governments. But it is  far more difficult to maintain numerous equipotent small centers of political  power in a single large government than it is to have numerous centers of  economic strength in a single large economy. There can be many millionaires in  one large economy. But can there be more than one really outstanding leader,  one person on whom the energies and enthusiasms of his countrymen are  centered? If the central government gains power, it is likely to be at the expense    21     of local governments. There seems to be something like a fixed total of political  power to be distributed. Consequently, if economic power is joined to political  power, concentration seems almost inevitable. On the other hand, if economic  power is kept in separate hands from political power, it can serve as a check and  a counter to political power.   The force of this abstract argument can perhaps best be demonstrated by  example. Let us consider first, a hypothetical example that may help to bring out  the principles involved, and then some actual examples from recent experience  that illustrate the way in which the market works to preserve political freedom.   One feature of a free society is surely the freedom of individuals to  advocate and propagandize openly for a radical change in the structure of the  society so long as the advocacy is restricted to persuasion and does not include  force or other forms of coercion. It is a mark of the political freedom of a  capitalist society that men can openly advocate and work for socialism. Equally,  political freedom in a socialist society would require that men be free to advocate  the introduction of capitalism. How could the freedom to advocate capitalism be  preserved and protected in a socialist society?   I n order for men to advocate anything, they must in the first place be able  to earn a living. This already raises a problem in a socialist society, since all jobs  are under the direct control of political authorities. It would take an act of self-  denial whose difficulty is underlined by experience in the United States after  World War II with the problem of ""security"" among Federal employees, for a  socialist government to permit its employees to advocate policies directly  contrary to official doctrine.   But let us suppose this act of self-denial to be achieved. For advocacy of  capitalism to mean anything, the proponents must be able to finance their cause  to hold public meetings, publish pamphlets, buy radio time, issue newspapers  and magazines, and so on. How could they raise the funds? There might and  probably would be men in the socialist society with large incomes, perhaps even  large capital sums in the form of government bonds and the like, but these  would of necessity be high public officials. It is possible to conceive of a minor  socialist official retaining his job although openly advocating capitalism. It strains  credulity to imagine the socialist top brass financing such ""subversive"" activities.   The only recourse for funds would be to raise small amounts from a large  number of minor officials. But this is no real answer. To tap these sources, many  people would already have to be persuaded, and our whole problem is how to  initiate and finance a campaign to do so. Radical movements in capitalist  societies have never been financed this way. They have typically been supported  by a few wealthy individuals who have become persuaded by a Frederick    22     Vanderbilt Field, or an Anita McCormick Blaine, or a Corliss Lamont, to mention a  few names recently prominent, or by a Friedrich Engels, to go farther back. This  is a role of inequality of wealth in preserving political freedom that is seldom  noted the role of the patron.   In a capitalist society, it is only necessary to convince a few wealthy  people to get funds to launch any idea, however strange, and there are many  such persons, many independent foci of support. And, indeed, it is not even  necessary to persuade people or financial institutions with available funds of the  soundness of the ideas to be propagated. It is only necessary to persuade them  that the propagation can be financially successful; that the newspaper or  magazine or book or other venture will be profitable. The competitive publisher,  for example, cannot afford to publish only writing with which he personally  agrees; his touchstone must be the likelihood that the market will be large  enough to yield a satisfactory return on his investment.   In this way, the market breaks the vicious circle and makes it possible  ultimately to finance such ventures by small amounts from many people without  first persuading them. There are no such possibilities in the socialist society;  there is only the all-powerful state.   Let us stretch our imagination and suppose that a socialist government is  aware of this problem and is composed of people anxious to preserve freedom.  Could it provide the funds? Perhaps, but it is difficult to see how. It could  establish a bureau for subsidizing subversive propaganda. But how could it  choose whom to support? If it gave to all who asked, it would shortly find itself  out of funds, for socialism cannot repeal the elementary economic law that a  sufficiently high price will call forth a large supply. Make the advocacy of radical  causes sufficiently remunerative, and the supply of advocates will be unlimited.   Moreover, freedom to advocate unpopular causes does not require that  such advocacy be without cost. On the contrary, no society could be stable if  advocacy of radical change were costless, much less subsidized. It is entirely  appropriate that men make sacrifices to advocate causes in which they deeply  believe. Indeed, it is important to preserve freedom only for people who are  willing to practice self-denial, for otherwise freedom degenerates into license and  irresponsibility. What is essential is that the cost of advocating unpopular causes  be tolerable and not prohibitive.   But we are not yet through. In a free market society, it is enough to have  the funds. The suppliers of paper are as willing to sell it to the Daily Worker as to  the Wall Street J ournal. In a socialist society, it would not be enough to have the  funds. The hypothetical supporter of capitalism would have to persuade a  government factory making paper to sell to him, the government printing press    23     to print his pamphlets, a government post office to distribute them among the  people, a government agency to rent him a hall in which to talk, and so on.   Perhaps there is some way in which one could overcome these difficulties  and preserve freedom in a socialist society. One cannot say it is utterly  impossible. What is clear, however, is that there are very real difficulties in  establishing institutions that will effectively preserve the possibility of dissent. So  far as I know, none of the people who have been in favor of socialism and also  in favor of freedom have really faced up to this issue, or made even a  respectable start at developing the institutional arrangements that would permit  freedom under socialism. By contrast, it is clear how a free market capitalist  society fosters freedom.   A striking practical example of these abstract principles is the experience  of Winston Churchill. From 1933 to the outbreak of World War II, Churchill was  not permitted to talk over the British radio, which was, of course, a government  monopoly administered by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Here was a  leading citizen of his country, a Member of Parliament, a former cabinet minister,  a man who was desperately trying by every device possible to persuade his  countrymen to take steps to ward off the menace of Hitler's Germany. He was  not permitted to talk over the radio to the British people because the BBC was a  government monopoly and his position was too ""controversial"".   Another striking example, reported in the January 26, 1959 issue of Time,  has to do with the ""Blacklist Fadeout"". Says the Time story,   The Oscar-awarding ritual is Hollywood's biggest pitch for dignity, but two  years ago dignity suffered. When one Robert Rich was announced as top writer  for The Brave One, he never stepped forward. Robert Rich was a pseudonym,  masking one of about 150 writers . . . blacklisted by the industry since 1947 as  suspected Communists or fellow travelers. The case was particularly  embarrassing because the Motion Picture Academy had barred any Communist  or Fifth Amendment pleader from Oscar competition. Last week both the  Communist rule and the mystery of Rich's identity were suddenly rescripted.   Rich turned out to be Dalton (Johnny Got His Gun) Trumbo, one of the  original ""Hollywood Ten"" writers who refused to testify at the 1947 hearings on  Communism in the movie industry. Said producer Frank King, who had stoutly  insisted that Robert Rich was ""a young guy in Spain with a beard"": ""We have an  obligation to our stockholders to buy the best script we can. Trumbo brought us  The Brave One and we bought it"". . . .   In effect it was the formal end of the Hollywood black list. For barred  writers, the informal end came long ago. At least 15% of current Hollywood films    24     are reportedly written by blacklist members. Said Producer King, ""There are  more ghosts in Hollywood than in Forest Lawn. Every company in town has used  the work of blacklisted people. We're just the first to confirm what everybody  knows.""    One may believe, as I do, that communism would destroy all of our  freedoms, one may be opposed to it as firmly and as strongly as possible, and  yet, at the same time, also believe that in a free society it is intolerable for a  man to be prevented from making voluntary arrangements with others that are  mutually attractive because he believes in or is trying to promote communism.  His freedom includes his freedom to promote communism. Freedom also, of  course, includes the freedom of others not to deal with him under those  circumstances. The Hollywood blacklist was an unfree act that destroys freedom  because it was a collusive arrangement that used coercive means to prevent  voluntary exchanges. It didn't work precisely because the market made it costly  for people to preserve the blacklist. The commercial emphasis, the fact that  people who are running enterprises have an incentive to make as much money  as they can, protected the freedom of the individuals who were blacklisted by  providing them with an alternative form of employment, and by giving people an  incentive to employ them.   If Hollywood and the movie industry had been government enterprises or  if in England it had been a question of employment by the British Broadcasting  Corporation it is difficult to believe that the ""Hollywood Ten"" or their equivalent  would have found employment. Equally, it is difficult to believe that under those  circumstances, strong proponents of individualism and private enterprise or  indeed strong proponents of any view other than the status quo would be able to  get employment.   Another example of the role of the market in preserving political freedom,  was revealed in our experience with McCarthyism. Entirely aside from the  substantive issues involved, and the merits of the charges made, what protection  did individuals, and in particular government employees, have against  irresponsible accusations and probings into matters that it went against their  conscience to reveal? Their appeal to the Fifth Amendment would have been a  hollow mockery without an alternative to government employment.   Their fundamental protection was the existence of a private-market  economy in which they could earn a living. Here again, the protection was not  absolute. Many potential private employers were, rightly or wrongly, averse to  hiring those pilloried. It may well be that there was far less justification for the  costs imposed on many of the people involved than for the costs generally  imposed on people who advocate unpopular causes. But the important point is    25     that the costs were limited and not prohibitive, as they would have been if  government employment had been the only possibility.   It is of interest to note that a disproportionately large fraction of the  people involved apparently went into the most competitive sectors of the  economy small business, trade, farming where the market approaches most  closely the ideal free market. No one who buys bread knows whether the wheat  from which it is made was grown by a Communist or a Republican, by a  constitutionalist or a Fascist, or, for that matter, by a Negro or a white. This  illustrates how an impersonal market separates economic activities from political  views and protects men from being discriminated against in their economic  activities for reasons that are irrelevant to thei
 productivity whether these  reasons are associated with their views or their color.   As this example suggests, the groups in our society that have the most at  stake in the preservation and strengthening of competitive capitalism are those  minority groups which can most easily become the object of the distrust and  enmity of the majority the Negroes, the Jews, the foreign-born, to mention only  the most obvious. Yet, paradoxically enough, the enemies of the free market the  Socialists and Communists have been recruited in disproportionate measure from  these groups. Instead of recognizing that the existence of the market has  protected them from the attitudes of their fellow countrymen, they mistakenly  attribute the residual discrimination to the market. ",Capitalism and Freedom  The Relation between Economic Freedom and Political Freedom,"In this chapter, Friedman promotes economic freedom as both a necessary freedom in itself and also as a vital means for political freedom. He argues that, with the means for production under the auspicies of the government, it is nearly impossible for real dissent and exchange of ideas to exist. Additionally, economic freedom is important, since any ""bi-laterally voluntary and informed"" transaction must benefit both parties to the transaction."
"The Role of Government in a Free Society   A common objection to totalitarian societies is that they regard the end as  justifying the means. Taken literally, this objection is clearly illogical. If the end  does not justify the means, what does? But this easy answer does not dispose of  the objection; it simply shows that the objection is not well put. To deny that the  end justifies the means is indirectly to assert that the end in question is not the  ultimate end, that the ultimate end is itself the use of the proper means.  Desirable or not, any end that can be attained only by the use of bad means  must give way to the more basic end of the use of acceptable means.   To the liberal, the appropriate means are free discussion and voluntary  co-operation, which implies that any form of coercion is inappropriate. The ideal  is unanimity among responsible individuals achieved on the basis of free and full  discussion. This is another way of expressing the goal of freedom emphasized in  the preceding chapter.   From this standpoint, the role of the market, as already noted, is that it  permits unanimity without conformity; that it is a system of effectively  proportional representation. On the other hand, the characteristic feature of  action through explicitly political channels is that it tends to require or to enforce  substantial conformity. The typical issue must be decided ""yes"" or ""no""; at most,  provision can be made for a fairly limited number of alternatives. Even the use of  proportional representation in its explicitly political form does not alter this  conclusion. The number of separate groups that can in fact be represented is  narrowly limited, enormously so by comparison with the proportional  representation of the market. More important, the fact that the final outcome  generally must be a law applicable to all groups, rather than separate legislative  enactments for each ""party"" represented, means that proportional representation  in its political version, far from permitting unanimity without conformity, tends  toward ineffectiveness and fragmentation. It thereby operates to destroy any  consensus on which unanimity with conformity can rest.   There are clearly some matters with respect to which effective  proportional representation is impossible. I cannot get the amount of national  defense I want and you, a different amount. With respect to such indivisible  matters we can discuss, and argue, and vote. But having decided, we must  conform. It is precisely the existence of such indivisible matters protection of the  individual and the nation from coercion are clearly the most basic that prevents  exclusive reliance on individual action through the market. If we are to use some    27     of our resources for such indivisible items, we must employ political channels to  reconcile differences.   The use of political channels, while inevitable, tends to strain the social  cohesion essential for a stable society. The strain is least if agreement for joint  action need be reached only on a limited range of issues on which people in any  event have common views. Every extension of the range of issues for which  explicit agreement is sought strains further the delicate threads that hold society  together. If it goes so far as to touch an issue on which men feel deeply yet  differently, it may well disrupt the society. Fundamental differences in basic  values can seldom if ever be resolved at the ballot box; ultimately they can only  be decided, though not resolved, by conflict. The religious and civil wars of  history are a bloody testament to this judgment.   The widespread use of the market reduces the strain on the social fabric  by rendering conformity unnecessary with respect to any activities it  encompasses. The wider the range of activities covered by the market, the fewer  are the issues on which explicitly political decisions are required and hence on  which it is necessary to achieve agreement. In turn, the fewer the issues on  which agreement is necessary, the greater is the likelihood of getting agreement  while maintaining a free society.   Unanimity is, of course, an ideal. In practice, we can afford neither the  time nor the effort that would be required to achieve complete unanimity on  every issue. We must perforce accept something less. We are thus led to accept  majority rule in one form or another as an expedient. That majority rule is an  expedient rather than itself a basic principle is clearly shown by the fact that our  willingness to resort to majority rule, and the size of the majority we require,  themselves depend on the seriousness of the issue involved. If the matter is of  little moment and the minority has no strong feelings about being overruled, a  bare plurality will suffice. On the other hand, if the minority feels strongly about  the issue involved, even a bare majority will not do. Few of us would be willing  to have issues of free speech, for example, decided by a bare majority. Our legal  structure is full of such distinctions among kinds of issues that require different  kinds of majorities. At the extreme are those issues embodied in the  Constitution. These are the principles that are so important that we are willing to  make minimal concessions to expediency. Something like essential consensus  was achieved initially in accepting them, and we require something like essential  consensus for a change in them.   The self-denying ordinance to refrain from majority rule on certain kinds  of issues that is embodied in our Constitution and in similar written or unwritten  constitutions elsewhere, and the specific provisions in these constitutions or their    28     equivalents prohibiting coercion of individuals, are themselves to be regarded as  reached by free discussion and as reflecting essential unanimity about means.   I turn now to consider more specifically, though still in very broad terms,  what the areas are that cannot be handled through the market at all, or can be  handled only at so great a cost that the use of political channels may be  preferable.   Government as Rule-Maker and Umpire   It is important to distinguish the day-to-day activities of people from the  general customary and legal framework within which these take place. The day-  to-day activities are like the actions of the participants in a game when they are  playing it; the framework, like the rules of the game they play. And just as a  good game requires acceptance by the players both of the rules and of the  umpire to interpret and enforce them, so a good society requires that its  members agree on the general conditions that will govern relations among them,  on some means of arbitrating different interpretations of these conditions, and  on some device for enforcing compliance with the generally accepted rules. As in  games, so also in society, most of the general conditions are the unintended  outcome of custom, accepted unthinkingly. At most, we consider explicitly only  minor modifications in them, though the cumulative effect of a series of minor  modifications may be a drastic alteration in the character of the game or of the  society. In both games and society also, no set of rules can prevail unless most  participants most of the time conform to them without external sanctions; unless  that is, there is a broad underlying social consensus. But we cannot rely on  custom or on this consensus alone to interpret and to enforce the rules; we need  an umpire. These then are the basic roles of government in a free society: to  provide a means whereby we can modify the rules, to mediate differences  among us on the meaning of the rules, and to enforce compliance with the rules  on the part of those few who would otherwise not play the game.   The need for government in these respects arises because absolute  freedom is impossible. However attractive anarchy may be as a philosophy, it is  not feasible in a world of imperfect men.   Men's freedoms can conflict, and when they do, one man's freedom must  be limited to preserve another's as a Supreme Court Justice once put it, ""My  freedom to move my fist must be limited by the proximity of your chin.""   The major problem in deciding the appropriate activities of government is  how to resolve such conflicts among the freedoms of different individuals. In  some cases, the answer is easy. There is little difficulty in attaining near  unanimity to the proposition that one man's freedom to murder his neighbor  must be sacrificed to preserve the freedom of the other man to live. In other    29     cases, the answer is difficult. In the economic area, a major problem arises in  respect of the conflict between freedom to combine and freedom to compete.  What meaning is to be attributed to ""free"" as modifying ""enterprise""? In the  United States, ""free"" has been understood to mean that anyone is free to set up  an enterprise, which means that existing enterprises are not free to keep out  competitors except by selling a better product at the same price or the same  product at a lower price. In the continental tradition, on the other hand, the  meaning has generally been that enterprises are free to do what they want,  including the fixing of prices, division of markets, and the adoption of other  techniques to keep out potential competitors. Perhaps the most difficult specific  problem in this area arises with respect to combinations among laborers, where  the problem of freedom to combine and freedom to compete is particularly  acute.    A still more basic economic area in which the answer is both difficult and  important is the definition of property rights. The notion of property, as it has  developed over centuries and as it is embodied in our legal codes, has become  so much a part of us that we tend to take it for granted, and fail to recognize the  extent to which just what constitutes property and what rights the ownership of  property confers are complex social creations rather than self-evident  propositions. Does my having title to land, for example, and my freedom to use  my property as I wish, permit me to deny to someone else the right to fly over  my land in his airplane? Or does his right to use his airplane take precedence? Or  does this depend on how high he flies? Or how much noise he makes? Does  voluntary exchange require that he pay me for the privilege of flying over my  land? Or that I must pay him to refrain from flying over it? The mere mention of  royalties, copyrights, patents; shares of stock in corporations; riparian rights, and  the like, may perhaps emphasize the role of generally accepted social rules in the  very definition of property. It may suggest also that, in many cases, the  existence of a well specified and generally accepted definition of property is far  more important than just what the definition is.   Another economic area that raises particularly difficult problems is the  monetary system. Government responsibility for the monetary system has long  been recognized. It is explicitly provided for in the constitutional provision which  gives Congress the power ""to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of  foreign coin."" There is probably no other area of economic activity with respect  to which government action has been so uniformly accepted. This habitual and  by now almost unthinking acceptance of governmental responsibility makes  thorough understanding of the grounds for such responsibility all the more  necessary, since it enhances the danger that the scope of government will  spread from activities that are, to those that are not, appropriate in a free  society, from providing a monetary framework to determining the allocation of    30     resources among individuals. We shall discuss this problem in detail in chapter iii.   In summary, the organization of economic activity through voluntary  exchange presumes that we have provided, through government, for the  maintenance of law and order to prevent coercion of one individual by another,  the enforcement of contracts voluntarily entered into, the definition of the  meaning of property rights, the interpretation and enforcement of such rights,  and the provision of a monetary framework.   Action Through Government on Grounds of Technical Monopoly and  Neighborhood Effects   The role of government just considered is to do something that the  market cannot do for itself, namely, to determine, arbitrate, and enforce the  rules of the game. We may also want to do through government some things  that might conceivably be done through the market but that technical or similar  conditions render it difficult to do in that way. These all reduce to cases in which  strictly voluntary exchange is either exceedingly costly or practically impossible.  There are two general classes of such cases: monopoly and similar market  imperfections, and neighborhood effects.   Exchange is truly voluntary only when nearly equivalent alternatives exist.  Monopoly implies the absence of alternatives and thereby inhibits effective  freedom of exchange. In practice, monopoly frequently, if not generally, arises  from government support or from collusive agreements among individuals. With  respect to these, the problem is either to avoid governmental fostering of  monopoly or to stimulate the effective enforcement of rules such as those  embodied in our anti-trust laws. However, monopoly may also arise because it is  technically efficient to have a single producer or enterprise. I venture to suggest  that such cases are more limited than is supposed but they unquestionably do  arise. A simple example is perhaps the provision of telephone services within a  community. I shall refer to such cases as ""technical"" monopoly.   When technical conditions make a monopoly the natural outcome of  competitive market forces, there are only three alternatives that seem available:  private monopoly, public monopoly, or public regulation. All three are bad so we  must choose among evils. Henry Simons, observing public regulation of  monopoly in the United States, found the results so distasteful that he concluded  public monopoly would be a lesser evil. Walter Eucken, a noted German liberal,  observing public monopoly in German railroads, found the results so distasteful  that he concluded public regulation would be a lesser evil. Having learned from  both, I reluctantly conclude that, if tolerable, private monopoly may be the least  of the evils.    31     If society were static so that the conditions which give rise to a technical  monopoly were sure to remain, I would have little confidence in this solution. In  a rapidly changing society, however, the conditions making for technical  monopoly frequently change and I suspect that both public regulation and public  monopoly are likely to be less responsive to such changes in conditions, to be  less readily capable of elimination, than private monopoly.   Railroads in the United States are an excellent example. A large degree of  monopoly in railroads was perhaps inevitable on technical grounds in the  nineteenth century. This was the justification for the Interstate Commerce  Commission. But conditions have changed. The emergence of road and air  transport has reduced the monopoly element in railroads to negligible  proportions. Yet we have not eliminated the ICC. On the contrary, the ICC, which  started out as an agency to protect the public from exploitation by the railroads,  has become an agency to protect railroads from competition by trucks and other  means of transport, and more recently even to protect existing truck companies  from competition by new entrants. Similarly, in England, when the railroads were  nationalized, trucking was at first brought into the state monopoly. If railroads  had never been subjected to regulation in the United States, it is nearly certain  that by now transportation, including railroads, would be a highly competitive  industry with little or no remaining monopoly elements.   The choice between the evils of private monopoly, public monopoly, and  public regulation cannot, however, be made once and for all, independently of  the factual circumstances. If the technical monopoly is of a service or commodity  that is regarded as esse
tial and if its monopoly power is sizable, even the short  run effects of private unregulated monopoly may not be tolerable, and either  public regulation or ownership may be a lesser evil.   Technical monopoly may on occasion justify a de facto public monopoly. It  cannot by itself justify a public monopoly achieved by making it illegal for anyone  else to compete. For example, there is no way to justify our present public  monopoly of the post office. It may be argued that the carrying of mail is a  technical monopoly and that a government monopoly is the least of evils. Along  these lines, one could perhaps justify a government post office but not the  present law, which makes it illegal for anybody else to carry mail. If the delivery  of mail is a technical monopoly, no one will be able to succeed in competition  with the government. If it is not, there is no reason why the government should  be engaged in it. The only way to find out is to leave other people free to enter.   The historical reason why we have a post office monopoly is because the  Pony Express did such a good job of carrying the mail across the continent that,  when the government introduced transcontinental service, it couldn't compete  effectively and lost money. The result was a law making it illegal for anybody    32     else to carry the mail. That is why the Adams Express Company is an investment  trust today instead of an operating company. I conjecture that if entry into the  mail-carrying business were open to all, there would be a large number of firms  entering it and this archaic industry would become revolutionized in short order.   A second general class of cases in which strictly voluntary exchange is  impossible arises when actions of individuals have effects on other individuals for  which it is not feasible to charge or recompense them. This is the problem of  ""neighborhood effects"".   An obvious example is the pollution of a stream. The man who pollutes a stream  is in effect forcing others to exchange good water for bad. These others might  be willing to make the exchange at a price. But it is not feasible for them, acting  individually, to avoid the exchange or to enforce appropriate compensation.   A less obvious example is the provision of highways. In this case, it is  technically possible to identify and hence charge individuals for their use of the  roads and so to have private operation. However, for general access roads,  involving many points of entry and exit, the costs of collection would be  extremely high if a charge were to be made for the specific services received by  each individual, because of the necessity of establishing toll booths or the  equivalent at all entrances. The gasoline tax is a much cheaper method of  charging individuals roughly in proportion to their use of the roads. This method,  however, is one in which the particular payment cannot be identified closely with  the particular use. Hence, it is hardly feasible to have private enterprise provide  the service and collect the charge without establishing extensive private  monopoly.   These considerations do not apply to long-distance turnpikes with high  density of traffic and limited access. For these, the costs of collection are small  and in many cases are now being paid, and there are often numerous  alternatives, so that there is no serious monopoly problem. Hence, there is every  reason why these should be privately owned and operated. If so owned and  operated, the enterprise running the highway should receive the gasoline taxes  paid on account of travel on it.   Parks are an interesting example because they illustrate the difference  between cases that can and cases that cannot be justified by neighborhood  effects, and because almost everyone at first sight regards the conduct of  National Parks as obviously a valid function of government. In fact, however,  neighborhood effects may justify a city park; they do not justify a national park,  like Yellowstone National Park or the Grand Canyon. What is the fundamental  difference between the two? For the city park, it is extremely difficult to identify  the people who benefit from it and to charge them for the benefits which they  receive. If there is a park in the middle of the city, the houses on all sides get    33     the benefit of the open space, and people who walk through it or by it also  benefit. To maintain toll collectors at the gates or to impose annual charges per  window overlooking the park would be very expensive and difficult. The  entrances to a national park like Yellowstone, on the other hand, are few; most  of the people who come stay for a considerable period of time and it is perfectly  feasible to set up toll gates and collect admission charges. This is indeed now  done, though the charges do not cover the whole costs. If the public wants this  kind of an activity enough to pay for it, private enterprises will have every  incentive to provide such parks. And, of course, there are many private  enterprises of this nature now in existence. I cannot myself conjure up any  neighborhood effects or important monopoly effects that would justify  governmental activity in this area.   Considerations like those I have treated under the heading of  neighborhood effects have been used to rationalize almost every conceivable  intervention. In many instances, however, this rationalization is special pleading  rather than a legitimate application of the concept of neighborhood effects.  Neighborhood effects cut both ways. They can be a reason for limiting the  activities of government as well as for expanding them. Neighborhood effects  impede voluntary exchange because it is difficult to identify the effects on third  parties and to measure their magnitude; but this difficulty is present in  governmental activity as well. It is hard to know when neighborhood effects are  sufficiently large to justify particular costs in overcoming them and even harder  to distribute the costs in an appropriate fashion. Consequently, when  government engages in activities to overcome neighborhood effects, it will in  part introduce an additional set of neighborhood effects by failing to charge or to  compensate individuals properly. Whether the original or the new neighborhood  effects are the more serious can only be judged by the facts of the individual  case, and even then, only very approximately. Furthermore, the use of  government to overcome neighborhood effects itself has an extremely important  neighborhood effect which is unrelated to the particular occasion for government  action. Every act of government intervention limits the area of individual freedom  directly and threatens the preservation of freedom indirectly for reasons  elaborated in the first chapter.   Our principles offer no hard and fast line how far it is appropriate to use  government to accomplish jointly what it is difficult or impossible for us to  accomplish separately through strictly voluntary exchange. In any particular case  of proposed intervention, we must make up a balance sheet, listing separately  the advantages and disadvantages. Our principles tell us what items to put on  the one side and what items on the other and they give us some basis for  attaching importance to the different items. In particular, we shall always want  to enter on the liability side of any proposed government intervention, its  neighborhood effect in threatening freedom, and give this effect considerable    34     weight. Just how much weight to give to it, as to other items, depends upon the  circumstances. If, for example, existing government intervention is minor, we  shall attach a smaller weight to the negative effects of additional government  intervention. This is an important reason why many earlier liberals, like Henry  Simons, writing at a time when government was small by today's standards,  were willing to have government undertake activities that today's liberals would  not accept now that government has become so overgrown.   Action Through Government on Paternalistic Grounds   Freedom is a tenable objective only for responsible individuals. We do not  believe in freedom for madmen or children. The necessity of drawing a line  between responsible individuals and others is inescapable, yet it means that  there is an essential ambiguity in our ultimate objective of freedom. Paternalism  is inescapable for those whom we designate as not responsible.   The clearest case, perhaps, is that of madmen. We are willing neither to  permit them freedom nor to shoot them. It would be nice if we could rely on  voluntary activities of individuals to house and care for the madmen. But I think  we cannot rule out the possibility that such charitable activities will be  inadequate, if only because of the neighborhood effect involved in the fact that I  benefit if another man contributes to the care of the insane. For this reason, we  may be willing to arrange for their care through government.   Children offer a more difficult case. The ultimate operative unit in our  society is the family, not the individual. Yet the acceptance of the family as the  unit rests in considerable part on expediency rather than principle. We believe  that parents are generally best able to protect their children and to provide for  their development into responsible individuals for whom freedom is appropriate.  But we do not believe in the freedom of parents to do what they will with other  people. The children are responsible individuals in embryo, and a believer in  freedom believes in protecting their ultimate rights.   To put this in a different and what may seem a more callous way, children  are at one and the same time consumer goods and potentially responsible  members of society. The freedom of individuals to use their economic resources  as they want includes the freedom to use them to have children to buy, as it  were, the services of children as a particular form of consumption. But once this  choice is exercised, the children have a value in and of themselves and have a  freedom of their own that is not simply an extension of the freedom of the  parents.   The paternalistic ground for governmental activity is in many ways the  most troublesome to a liberal; for it involves the acceptance of a principle that    35     some shall decide for others which he finds objectionable in most applications  and which he rightly regards as a hallmark of his chief intellectual opponents, the  proponents of collectivism in one or another of its guises, whether it be  communism, socialism, or a welfare state. Yet there is no use pretending that  problems are simpler than in fact they are. There is no avoiding the need for  some measure of paternalism. As Dicey wrote in 1914 about an act for the  protection of mental defectives, ""The Mental Deficiency Act is the first step along  a path on which no sane man can decline to enter, but which, if too far pursued,  will bring statesmen across difficulties hard to meet without considerable  interference with individual liberty."" 1 There is no formula that can tell us where  to stop. We must rely on our fallible judgment and, having reached a judgment,  on our ability to persuade our fellow men that it is a correct judgment, or their  ability to persuade us to modify our views. We must put our faith, here as  elsewhere, in a consensus reached by imperfect and biased men through free  discussion and trial and error.   Conclusion   A government which maintained law and order, defined property rights,  served as a means whereby we could modify property rights and other rules of  the economic game, adjudicated disputes about the interpretation of the rules,  enforced contracts, promoted competition, provided a monetary framework,  engaged in activities to counter technical monopolies and to overcome  neighborhood effects widely regarded as sufficiently important to justify  government intervention, and which supplemented private charity and the  private family in protecting the irresponsible, whether madman or child such a  government would clearly have important functions to perform. The consistent  liberal is not an anarchist.   Yet it is also true that such a government would have clearly limited  functions and would refrain from a host of activities that are now undertaken by  federal and state governments in the United States, and their counterparts in  other Western countries. Succeeding chapters will deal in some detail with some  of these activities, and a few have been discussed above, but it may help to give  a sense of proportion about the role that a liberal would assign government  simply to list, in closing this chapter, some activities currently undertaken by  government in the U.S., that cannot, so far as I can see, validly be justified in  terms of the principles outlined above",Capitalism and Freedom  The Role of Government in a Free Society,"According to the author, the government of a liberal society should enforce law and order and property rights, as well as take action on certain technical monopolies and diminish negative ""neighborhood effects."" The government should also have control over money, as has long been recognized in the constitution and society"
"""Full employment"" and ""economic growth"" have in the past few decades  become primary excuses for widening the extent of government intervention in  economic affairs. A private free-enterprise economy, it is said, is inherently  unstable. Left to itself, it will produce recurrent cycles of boom and bust. The  government must therefore step in to keep things on an even keel. These  arguments were particularly potent during and after the Great Depression of the  1930's, and were a major element giving rise to the New Deal in this country and  comparable extensions of governmental intervention in others. More recently,  ""economic growth"" has become the more popular rallying call. Government must,  it is argued, see to it that the economy expands to provide the wherewithal for  the cold war and demonstrate to the uncommitted nations of the world that a  democracy can grow more rapidly than a communist state.   These arguments are thoroughly misleading. The fact is that the Great  Depression, like most other periods of severe unemployment, was produced by  government mismanagement rather than by any inherent instability of the  private economy. A governmentally established agency the Federal Reserve  System had been assigned responsibility for monetary policy. In 1930 and 1931,  it exercised this responsibility so ineptly as to convert what otherwise would have  been a moderate contraction into a major catastrophe (see further discussion,  pages 4550, below). Similarly today, governmental measures constitute the  major impediments to economic growth in the United States. Tariffs and other  restrictions on international trade, high tax burdens and a complex and  inequitable tax structure, regulatory commissions, government price and wage  fixing, and a host of other measures give individuals an incentive to misuse and  misdirect resources, and distort the investment of new savings. What we  urgently need, for both economic stability and growth, is a reduction of  government intervention not an increase.   Such a reduction would still leave an important role for government in  these areas. It is desirable that we use government to provide a stable monetary  framework for a free economy this is part of the function of providing a stable  legal framework. It is desirable too that we use government to provide a general  legal and economic framework that will enable individuals to produce growth in  the economy, if that is in accord with their values.   The major areas of governmental policy that are relevant to economic  stability are monetary policy and fiscal or budgetary policy. This chapter    39     discusses domestic monetary policy, the next, international monetary  arrangements, and chapter v, fiscal or budgetary policy.   Our task in this and the following chapter is to steer a course between  two views, neither of which is acceptable though both have their attractions. The  Scylla is the belief that a purely automatic gold standard is both feasible and  desirable and would resolve all the problems of fostering economic co-operation  among individuals and nations in a stable environment. The Charybdis is the  belief that the need to adapt to unforeseen circumstances requires the  assignment of wide discretionary powers to a group of technicians, gathered  together in an ""independent"" central bank, or in some bureaucratic body. Neither  has proved a satisfactory solution in the past; and neither is likely to in the  future.    A liberal is fundamentally fearful of concentrated power. His objective is to  preserve the maximum degree of freedom for each individual separately that is  compatible with one man's freedom not interfering with other men's freedom. He  believes that this objective requires that power be dispersed. He is suspicious of  assigning to government any functions that can be performed through the  market, both because this substitutes coercion for voluntary co-operation in the  area in question and because, by giving government an increased role, it  threatens freedom in other areas.   The need for the dispersal of power raises an especially difficult problem  in the field of money. There is widespread agreement that government must  have some responsibility for monetary matters. There is also widespread  recognition that control over money can be a potent tool for controlling and  shaping the economy. Its potency is dramatized in Lenin's famous dictum that  the most effective way to destroy a society is to destroy its money. It is  exemplified in more pedestrian fashion by the extent to which control of money  has, from time immemorial, enabled sovereigns to exact heavy taxes from the  populace at large, very often without the explicit agreement of the legislature  when there has been one. This has been true from early times when monarchs  clipped coins and adopted similar expedients to the present with our more  sophisticated modern techniques for turning the printing press or simply altering  book entries. The problem is to establish institutional arrangements that will  enable government to exercise responsibility for money, yet at the same time  limit the power thereby given to government and prevent this power from being  used in ways that will tend to weaken rather than strengthen a free society.   A Commodity Standard   Historically, the device that has evolved most frequently in many different  places and over the course of centuries is a commodity standard; i.e. , the use as    40     money of some physical commodity such as gold or silver, brass or tin, cigarettes  or cognac, or various other goods. If money consisted wholly of a physical  commodity of this type, there would be, in principle, no need for control by the  government at all. The amount of money in society would depend on the cost of  producing the monetary commodity rather than other things. Changes in the  amount of money would depend on changes in the technical conditions of  producing the monetary commodity and on changes in the demand for money.  This is an ideal that animates many believers in an automatic gold standard.   Actual commodity standards have deviated very far from this simple  pattern which requires no governmental intervention. Historically, a commodity  standard such as a gold standard or a silver standard has been accompanied by  the development of fiduciary money of one kind or another, ostensibly  convertible into the monetary commodity on fixed terms. There was a very good  reason for this development. The fundamental defect of a commodity standard,  from the point of view of the society as a whole, is that it requires the use of real  resources to add to the stock of money. People must work hard to dig gold out  of the ground in South African order to rebury it in Fort Knox or some similar  place. The necessity of using real resources for the operation of a commodity  standard establishes a strong incentive for people to find ways to achieve the  same result without employing these resources. If people will accept as money  pieces of paper on which is printed ""I promise to pay units of the commodity  standard,"" these pieces of paper can perform the same function as the physical  pieces of gold or silver, and they require very much less in resources to produce.  This point, which I have discussed at somewhat greater length elsewhere, 1  seems to me the fundamental difficulty with a commodity standard.   If an automatic commodity standard were feasible, it would provide an  excellent solution to the liberal's dilemma: a stable monetary framework without  the danger of the irresponsible exercise of monetary powers. If, for example, an  honest-to-goodness gold standard, in which 100 per cent of the money in a  country consisted literally of gold, were widely backed by the public at large,  imbued with the mythology of a gold standard and with the belief that it is  immoral and improper for government to interfere with its operation, it would  provide an effective guarantee against governmental tinkering with the currency  and against irresponsible monetary action. Under such a standard, any monetary  powers of government would be very minor in scope. But, as just noted, such an  automatic system has historically never proved feasible. It has always tended to  develop in the direction of a mixed system containing fiduciary elements such as  bank notes and deposits, or government notes in addition to the monetary  commodity. And once fiduciary elements have been introduced, it has proved  difficult to avoid governmental control over them, even when they were initially  issued by private individuals. The reason is basically the difficulty of preventing  counterfeiting or its economic equivalent. Fiduciary money is a contract to pay    41     standard money. It so happens that there tends to be a long interval between  the making of such a contract and its realization. This enhances the difficulty of  enforcing the contract and hence also the temptation to issue fraudulent  contracts. In addition, once fiduciary elements have been introduced, the  temptation for government itself to issue fiduciary money is almost irresistible. In  practice, therefore, commodity standards have tended to become mixed  standards involving extensive intervention by the state.   It should be noted that despite the great amount of talk by many people  in favor of the gold standard, almost no one today literally desires an honest-to-  goodness, full gold standard. People who say they want a gold standard are  almost invariably talking about the present kind of standard, or the kind of  standard that was maintained in the 1930's; a gold standard managed by a  central bank or other governmental bureau, which holds a small amount of gold  as ""backing"" to use that very misleading term for fiduciary money. Some do go  so far as to favor the kind of standard maintained in the 1920's, in which there  was literal circulation of gold or gold certificates as hand-to-hand currency a  gold-coin standard but even they favor the coexistence with gold of  governmental fiduciary currency plus deposits issued by banks holding fractional  reserves in either gold or fiduciary currency. Even during the so-called great days  of the gold standard in the nineteenth century, when the Bank of England was  supposedly running the gold standard skillfully, the monetary system was far  from a fully automatic gold standard. Even then it was a highly managed  standard. And certainly the situation is now more extreme as a result of the  adoption by country after country of the view that government has responsibility  for ""full employment.""   My conclusion is that an automatic commodity standard is neither a  feasible nor a desirable solution to the problem of establishing monetary  arrangements for a free society. It is not desirable because it would involve a  large cost in the form of resources used to produce the monetary commodity. It  is not feasible because the mythology and beliefs required to make it effective do  not exist.   This conclusion is supported not only by the general historical evidence  referred to but also by the specific experience of the United States. From 1879,  when the United States resumed gold payments after the Civil War, to 1913, the  United States was on a gold standard. Though closer to a thoroughly automatic  gold standard than anything we have had since the end of World War I, the gold  standard was still far from a 100 per cent gold standard. There were government  issues of paper money, and private banks issued most of the effective circulating  medium of the country in the form of deposits; the banks were closely regulated  in their operations by governmental agencies national banks by the Comptroller  of the Currency, state banks by state banking authorities. Gold, whether held by    42     the Treasury, by banks, or directly by individuals as coins or gold certificates,  accounted for between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the money stock, the  exact percentage varying from year to year. The remaining 80 per cent to 90 per  cent consisted of silver, fiduciary currency, and bank deposits not matched by  gold reserves.   In retrospect, the system may seem to us to have worked reasonably  well. To Americans of the time, it clearly did not. The agitation over silver in the  1880's, culminating in Bryan's Cross of Gold speech which set the tone for the  1896 election, was one sign of dissatisfaction. In turn, the agitation was largely  responsible for the severely depressed years in the early 1890's. The agitation  led to widespread fears that the United States would go off gold and that hence  the dollar would lose value in terms of foreign currencies. This led to a flight  from the dollar and a capital outflow that forced deflation at home.   Successive financial crises, in 1873, 1884, 1890, and 1893 produced a  widespread demand for banking reform on the part of the business and banking  community. The panic of 1907, involving the concerted refusal by banks to  convert deposits into currency on demand, finally crystallized the feeling of  dissatisfaction with the financial system into an urgent demand for governmental  action. A National Monetary Commission was established by Congress, and its  recommendations, reported in 1910, were embodied in the Federal Reserve Act  passed in 1913. Reforms along the lines of the Federal Reserve Act had the  backing of every section of the community, from the working classes to the  bankers, and of both political parties. The chairman of the National Monetary  Commission was a Republican, Nelson W. Aldrich; the Senator mainly responsible  for the Federal Reserve Act was a Democrat, Carter W. Glass.   The change in monetary arrangements introduced by the Federal Reserve  Act turned out in practice to be far more drastic than was intended by its authors  or its supporters. At the time the Act was passed, a gold standard reigned  supreme throughout the world not a fully automatic gold standard but something  far closer to that ideal than anything we have experienced since. It was taken for  granted that it would continue to do so and thus narrowly limit the powers of the  Federal Reserve System. No sooner was the Act passed than World War I broke  out. There was a large-scale abandonment of the gold standard. By the end of  the war, the Reserve System was no longer a minor adjunct to the gold standard  designed to insure the convertibility of one form of money into others and to  regulate and supervise banks. It had become a powerful discretionary authority  able to determine the quantity of money in the United States and to affect  international financial conditions throughout the world.    43     A Discretionary Monetary Authority   The establishment of the Federal Reserve System was the most notable  change in United States monetary institutions since at least the Civil War  National Banking Act. For the first time since the expiration of the charter of the  Second Bank of the United States in 1836, it established a separate official body  charged with explicit responsibility for monetary conditions, and supposedly  clothed with adequate power to achieve monetary stability or, at least, to  prevent pronounced instability. It is therefore instructive to compare experience  as a whole before and after its establishment say, from just after the Civil War to  1914 and from 1914 to date, to take two periods of equal length.   The second period was clearly the more unstable economically, whether  instability is measured by the fluctuations in the stock of money, in prices, or in  output. Partly, the greater instability reflects the effect of two world wars during  the second period; these would clearly have been a source of instability  whatever our monetary system. But even if the war and immediate postwar  years are omitted, and we consider only the peacetime years from, say, 1920  through 1939, and 1947 to date, the result is the same. The stock of money,  prices, and output was decidedly more unstable after the establishment of the  Reserve System than before. The most dramatic period of instability in output  was of course the period between the two wars which includes the severe  contractions of 192021, 192933, and 193738. No
other twenty-year period in  American history contains as many as three such severe contractions.   This crude comparison does not of course prove that the Federal Reserve  System failed to contribute to monetary stability. Perhaps the problems that the  System had to handle were more severe than those that impinged on the earlier  monetary structure. Perhaps those problems would have produced an even  greater degree of monetary instability under the earlier arrangements. But the  crude comparison should at least give the reader pause before he takes for  granted, as is so often done, that an agency as long established, as powerful, as  pervasive as the Federal Reserve System is performing a necessary and desirable  function and is contributing to the attainment of the objectives for which it was  established.   I am myself persuaded, on the basis of extensive study of the historical  evidence, that the difference in economic stability revealed by the crude  comparison is in fact attributable to the difference in monetary institutions. This  evidence persuades me that at least a third of the price rise during and just after  World War I is attributable to the establishment of the Federal Reserve System  and would not have occurred if the earlier banking system had been retained;  that the severity of each of the major contractionsl92021, 192933, and 193738is  directly attributable to acts of commission and omission by the Reserve    44     authorities and would not have occurred under earlier monetary and banking  arrangements. There might well have been recessions on these or other  occasions, but it is highly unlikely that any would have developed into a major  contraction.   I clearly cannot present this evidence here. 2 However, in view of the  importance which the Great Depression of 192933 played in forming or, I would  say, deforming general attitudes toward the role of government in economic  affairs, it may be worth indicating more fully for this episode the kind of  interpretation suggested by the evidence.   Because of its dramatic character, the stock market crash in October,  1929, which terminated the bull market of 1928 and 1929 is often regarded as  both the start and the major proximate cause of the Great Depression. Neither is  correct. The peak of business was reached in mid-1929, some months prior to  the crash. The peak may well have come as early as it did partly as a result of  relatively tight money conditions imposed by the Federal Reserve System in an  attempt to curb ""speculation"" in this indirect way, the stock market may have  played a role in bringing about the contraction. The stock market crash in turn  undoubtedly had some indirect effects on business confidence and on the  willingness of individuals to spend which exerted a depressing influence on the  course of business. But by themselves, these effects could not have produced a  collapse in economic activity. At most, they would have made the contraction  somewhat longer and more severe than the usual mild recessions that have  punctuated American economic growth throughout our history; they would not  have made it the catastrophe it was.   For something like the first year, the contraction showed none of those  special features that were to dominate its later course. The economic decline  was more severe than during the first year of most contractions, possibly in  response to the stock market crash plus the unusually tight monetary conditions  that had been maintained since mid-1928. But it showed no qualitatively  different characteristics, no signs of degenerating into a major catastrophe.  Except on naive post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning, there is nothing in the  economic situation as it stood in, say, September or October, 1930 that made  the continued and drastic decline of the following years inevitable or even highly  probable. In retrospect, it is clear that the Reserve System should already have  been behaving differently than it did, that it should not have allowed the money  stock to decline by nearly 3 per cent from August 1929 to October 1930a larger  decline than during the whole of all but the most severe prior contractions.  Though this was a mistake, it was perhaps excusable, and certainly not critical.   The character of the contraction changed drastically in November 1930,  when a series of bank failures led to widespread runs on banks, which is to say    45     attempts by depositors to convert deposits into currency. The contagion spread  from one part of the country to another and reached a climax with the failure on  December 11, 1930 of the Bank of the United States. This failure was critical not  only because the Bank was one of the largest in the country, with over $ 200  million in deposits, but also because, though an ordinary commercial bank, its  name had led many both at home and even more abroad to regard it as  somehow an official bank.   Prior to October, 1930, there had been no sign of a liquidity crisis, or any  loss of confidence in banks. From this time on, the economy was plagued by  recurrent liquidity crises. A wave of bank failures would taper down a while, and  then start up again as a few dramatic failures or other events produced a new  loss of confidence in the banking system and a new series of runs on banks.  These were important not only or even primarily because of the failures of the  banks but because of their effect on the money stock.   In a fractional reserve banking system like ours, a bank does not of  course have a dollar of currency (or its equivalent) for a dollar of deposits. That  is why ""deposits"" is such a misleading term. When you deposit a dollar of cash in  a bank, the bank may add fifteen or twenty cents to its cash; the rest it will lend  out through another window. The borrower may in turn redeposit it, in this or  another bank, and the process is repeated. The result is that for every dollar of  cash owned by banks, they owe several dollars of deposits. The total stock of  money cash plus deposits for a given amount of cash is therefore higher the  larger the fraction of its money the public is willing to hold as deposits. Any  widespread attempt on the part of depositors to ""get their money"" must  therefore mean a decline in the total amount of money unless there is some way  in which additional cash can be created and some way for banks to get it.  Otherwise, one bank, in trying to satisfy its depositors, will put pressure on other  banks by calling loans or selling investments or withdrawing its deposits and  these other banks in turn will put pressure on still others. The vicious cycle, if  allowed to proceed, grows on itself as the attempt of banks to get cash forces  down the prices of securities, renders banks insolvent that would otherwise have  been entirely sound, shakes the confidence of depositors, and starts the cycle  over again.   This was precisely the kind of a situation that had led to a banking panic  under the pre-Federal-Reserve banking system, and to a concerted suspension of  the convertibility of deposits into currency, as in 1907. Such a suspension was a  drastic step and for a short while made matters worse. But it was also a  therapeutic measure. It cut short the vicious cycle by preventing the spread of  the contagion, by keeping the failure of a few banks from producing pressure on  other banks and leading to the failure of otherwise sound banks. In a few weeks    46     or months, when the situation had stabilized, the suspension could be lifted, and  recovery begin without monetary contraction.   As we have seen, one of the major reasons for establishing the Federal  Reserve System was to deal with such a situation. It was given the power to  create more cash if a widespread demand should arise on the part of the public  for currency instead of deposits, and was given the means to make the cash  available to banks on the security of the bank's assets. In this way, it was  expected that any threatened panic could be averted, that there would be no  need for suspension of convertibility of deposits into currency, and that the  depressing effects of monetary crises could be entirely avoided.   The first need for these powers and hence the first test of their efficacy  came in November and December of 1930 as a result of the string of bank  closings already described. The Reserve System failed the test miserably. It did  little or nothing to provide the banking system with liquidity, apparently  regarding the bank closings as calling for no special action. It is worth  emphasizing, however, that the System's failure was a failure of will, not of  power. On this occasion, as on the later ones that followed, the System had  ample power to provide the banks with the cash their depositors were  demanding. Had this been done, the bank closings would have been cut short  and the monetary debacle averted.   The initial wave of bank failures died down and in early 1931 there were  signs of returning confidence. The Reserve System took advantage of the  opportunity to reduce its own credit outstanding which is to say, it offset the  naturally expansionary forces by engaging in mild deflationary action. Even so,  there were clear signs of improvement not only in the monetary sector but also  in other economic activities. The figures for the first four or five months of 1931,  if examined without reference to what actually followed, have all the earmarks of  the bottom of a cycle and the beginning of revival.   The tentative revival was however short-lived. Renewed bank failures  started another series of runs and again set in train a renewed decline in the  stock of money. Again, the Reserve System stood idly by. In the face of an  unprecedented liquidation of the commercial banking system, the books of the  ""lender of last resort"" show a decline in the amount of credit it made available to  its member banks.   In September 1931, Britain went off the gold standard. This act was  preceded and followed by gold withdrawals from the United States. Although  gold had been flowing into the United States in the prior two years, and the U.S.  gold stock and the Federal Reserve gold reserve ratio were at an all time high,  the Reserve System reacted vigorously and promptly to the external drain as it    47     had not to the previous internal drain. It did so in a manner that was certain to  intensify the internal financial difficulties. After more than two years of severe  economic contraction, the System raised the discount rate the rate of interest at  which it stood ready to lend to member banks more sharply than it has within so  brief a period in its whole history before or since. The measure arrested the gold  drain. It was also accompanied by a spectacular increase in bank failures and  runs on banks. In the six months from August 1931 through January 1932,  roughly one out of ten banks in existence suspended operations and total  deposits in commercial banks fell by 15 per cent.   A temporary reversal of policy in 1932 involving the purchase of $ 1 billion  of government bonds slowed down the rate of decline. Had this measure been  taken in 1931, it would almost surely have been sufficient to prevent the debacle  just described. By 1932, it was too late to be more than a palliative and, when  the System relapsed into passivity, the temporary improvement was followed by  a renewed collapse terminating in the Banking Holiday of 1933 when every bank  in the United States was officially closed for over a week. A system established in  large part to prevent a temporary suspension of convertibility of deposits into  currency a measure that had formerly prevented banks from failing first let  nearly a third of the banks of the country go out of existence and then welcomed  a suspension of convertibility that was incomparably more sweeping and severe  than any earlier suspension. Yet so great is the capacity for self-justification that  the Federal Reserve Board could write in its annual report for 1933, ""The ability  of the Federal Reserve Banks to meet enormous demands for currency during  the crisis demonstrated the effectiveness of the country's currency system under  the Federal Reserve Act. ... It is difficult to say what the course of the  depression would have been had the Federal Reserve System not pursued a  policy of liberal open market purchases.""   All told, from July 1929 to March 1933, the money stock in the United  States fell by one-third, and over two-thirds of the decline came after England's  departure from the gold standard. Had the money stock been kept from  declining, as it clearly could and should have been, the contraction would have  been both shorter and far milder. It might still have been relatively severe by  historical standards. But it is literally inconceivable that money income could  have declined by over one-half and prices by over one-third in the course of four  years if there had been no decline in the stock of money. I know of no severe  depression in any country or any time that was not accompanied by a sharp  decline in the stock of money and equally of no sharp decline in the stock of  money that was not accompanied by a severe depression.   The Great Depression in the United States, far from being a sign of the  inherent instability of the private enterprise system, is a testament to how much    48     harm can be done by mistakes on the part of a few men when they wield vast  power over the monetary system of a country.   It may be that these mistakes were excusable on the basis of the  knowledge available to men at the time though I happen to think not. But that is  really beside the point. Any system which gives so much power and so much  discretion to a few men that mistakes excusable or not can have such far-  reaching effects is a bad system. It is a bad system to believers in freedom just  because it gives a few men such power without any effective check by the body  politic this is the key political argument against an ""independent"" central bank.  But it is a bad system even to those who set security higher than freedom.  Mistakes, excusable or not, cannot be avoided in a system which disperses  responsibility yet gives a few men great power, and which thereby makes  important policy actions highly dependent on accidents of personality. This is the  key technical argument against an ""independent"" bank. To paraphrase  Clemenceau, money is much too serious a matter to be left to the Central  Bankers.   Rules Instead of Authorities   If we can achieve our objectives neither by relying on the working of a  thoroughly automatic gold standard nor by giving wide discretion to independent  authorities, how else can we establish a monetary system that is stable and at  the same time free from irresponsible governmental tinkering, a system that will  provide the necessary monetary framework for a free enterprise economy yet be  incapable of being used as a source of power to threaten economic and political  freedom?   The only way that has yet been suggested that offers promise is to try to  achieve a government of law instead of men by legislating rules for the conduct  of monetary policy that will have the effect of enabling the public to exercise  control over monetary policy through its political authorities, while at the same  time it will prevent monetary policy from being subject to the day-by-day whim  of political authorities.   The issue of legislating rules for monetary policy has much in common  with a topic that seems at first altogether different, namely, the argument for the  first amendment to the Constitution. Whenever anyone suggests the desirability  of a legislative rule for control over money, the stereotyped answer is that it  makes little sense to tie the monetary authority's hands in this way because the  authority, if it wants to, can always do of its own volition what the rule would  require it to do, and in addition has other alternatives, hence ""surely,"" it is said,  it can do better than the rule. An alternative version of the same argument  applies it to the legislature. If the legislature is willing to adopt the rule, it is said,    49     surely it will also be willing to legislate the ""right"" policy in each 
pecific case.  How then, it is said, does the adoption of the rule provide any protection against  irresponsible political action?   The same argument could apply with only minor verbal changes to the  first amendment to the Constitution and, equally, to the entire Bill of Rights. Is it  not absurd, one might say, to have a standard proscription of interference with  free speech?   Why not take up each case separately and treat it on its own merits? Is  this not the counterpart to the usual argument in monetary policy that it is  undesirable to bind the hands of the monetary authority in advance; that it  should be left free to treat each case on its merits as it comes up? Why is not the  argument equally valid for speech? One man wants to stand up on a street  corner and advocate birth control; another, communism; a third, vegetarianism,  and so on, ad infinitum. Why not enact a law affirming or denying to each the  right to spread his particular views? Or, alternatively, why not give the power to  decide the issue to an administrative agency? It is immediately clear that if we  were to take each case up as it came, a majority would almost surely vote to  deny free speech in most cases and perhaps even in every case taken  separately. A vote on whether Mr. X should spread birth control propaganda  would almost surely yield a majority saying no; and so would one on  communism. The vegetarian might perhaps get by though even that is by no  means a foregone conclusion.   But now suppose all these cases were grouped together in one bundle,  and the populace at large were asked to vote for them as a whole; to vote  whether free speech should be denied in all cases or permitted in all alike. It is  perfectly conceivable, and I would say, highly probable, that an overwhelming  majority would vote for free speech; that, acting on the bundle as a whole, the  people would vote exactly the opposite to the way they would have voted on  each case separately. Why? One reason is that each person feels much more  strongly about being deprived of his right to free speech when he is in a minority  than he feels about depriving somebody else of the right to free speech when he  is in the majority. In consequence, when he votes on the bundle as a whole, he  gives much more weight to the infrequent denial of free speech to himself when  he is in the minority than to the frequent denial of free speech to others.   Another reason, and one that is more directly relevant to monetary policy,  is that if the bundle is viewed as a whole, it becomes clear that the policy  followed has cumulative effects that tend neither to be recognized nor taken into  account when each case is voted on separately. When a vote is taken on  whether Mr. Jones can speak on the corner, it cannot allow for the favorable  effects of an announced general policy of free speech. It cannot allow for the    50     fact that a society in which people are not free to speak on the corner without  special legislation will be a society in which the development of new ideas,  experimentation, change, and the like will all be hampered in a great variety of  ways that are obvious to all, thanks to our good fortune of having lived in a  society which did adopt the self-denying ordinance of not considering each case  of speech separately.   Exactly the same considerations apply in the monetary area. If each case  is considered on its merits, the wrong decision is likely to be made in a large  fraction of cases because the decision-makers are examining only a limited area  and not taking into account the cumulative consequences of the policy as a  whole. On the other hand, if a general rule is adopted for a group of cases as a  bundle, the existence of that rule has favorable effects on people's attitudes and  beliefs and expectations that would not follow even from the discretionary  adoption of precisely the same policy on a s cries of separate occasions.   If a rule is to be legislated, what rule should it be? The rule that has most  frequently been suggested by people of a generally liberal persuasion is a price  level rule; namely, a legislative directive to the monetary authorities that they  maintain a stable price level. I think this is the wrong kind of a rule. It is the  wrong kind of a rule because it is in terms of objectives that the monetary  authorities do not have the clear and direct power to achieve by their own  actions. It consequently raises the problem of dispersing responsibilities and  leaving the authorities too much leeway. There is unquestionably a close  connection between monetary actions and the price level. But the connection is  not so close, so invariable, or so direct that the objective of achieving a stable  price level is an appropriate guide to the day-to-day activities of the authorities.   The issue what rule to adopt is one that I have considered at some length  elsewhere. 3 Accordingly, I will limit myself here to stating my conclusion. In the  present state of our knowledge, it seems to me desirable to state the rule in  terms of the behavior of the stock of money. My choice at the moment would be  a legislated rule instructing the monetary authority to achieve a specified rate of  growth in the stock of money. For this purpose, I would define the stock of  money as including currency outside commercial banks plus all deposits of  commercial banks. I would specify that the Reserve System shall see to it that  the total stock of money so defined rises month by month, and indeed, so far as  possible, day by day, at an annual rate of X per cent, where X is some number  between 3 and 5. The precise definition of money adopted, or the precise rate of  growth chosen, makes far less difference than the definite choice of a particular  definition and a particular rate of growth.   As matters now stand, while this rule would drastically curtail the  discretionary power of the monetary authorities, it would still leave an    51     undesirable amount of discretion in the hands of Federal Reserve and Treasury  authorities with respect to how to achieve the specified rate of growth in the  money stock, debt management, banking supervision, and the like. Further  banking and fiscal reforms, which I have spelled out in detail elsewhere, are both  feasible and desirable. They would have the effect of eliminating present  governmental intervention into lending and investing activity and of converting  governmental financing operations from a perpetual source of instability and  uncertainty into a reasonably regular and predictable activity. But, though  important, these further reforms are far less basic than the adoption of a rule to  limit the discretion of the monetary authorities with respect to the stock of  money.   I should like to emphasize that I do not regard my particular proposal as a  be-all and end-all of monetary management, as a rule which is somehow to be  written in tablets of stone and enshrined for all future time. It seems to me to be  the rule that offers the greatest promise of achieving a reasonable degree of  monetary stability in the light of our present knowledge. I would hope that as we  operated with it, as we learned more about monetary matters, we might be able  to devise still better rules, which would achieve still better results. Such a rule  seems to me the only feasible device currently available for converting monetary  policy into a pillar of a free society rather than a threat to its foundations. ",Capitalism and Freedom  The Control of Money,"He discusses the evolution of money in America, culminating in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Far from acting as a stabilizer, the Federal Reserve failed to act as it should have in several circumstances. Friedman proposes that the Federal Reserve have a consistent rule to increase the money supply by 3-5% annually."
"The problem of international monetary arrangements is the relation  among different national currencies: the terms and conditions under which  individuals are able to convert U.S. dollars to pounds sterling, Canadian dollars to  U.S. dollars, and so on. This problem is closely connected with the control of  money discussed in the preceding chapter. It is connected also with  governmental policies about international trade, since control over international  trade is one technique for affecting international payments.   The Importance of International Monetary Arrangements for  Economic Freedom   Despite its technical character and forbidding complexity, the subject of  international monetary arrangements is one that a liberal cannot afford to  neglect. It is not too much to say that the most serious short-run threat to  economic freedom in the United States today aside, of course, from the outbreak  of World War III is that we shall be led to adopt far-reaching economic controls  in order to ""solve"" balance of payments problems. Interferences with  international trade appear innocuous; they can get the support of people who  are otherwise apprehensive of interference by government into economic affairs;  many a business man even regards them as part of the ""American Way of Life"";  yet there are few interferences which are capable of spreading so far and  ultimately being so destructive of free enterprise. There is much experience to  suggest that the most effective way to convert a market economy into an  authoritarian economic society is to start by imposing direct controls on foreign  exchange. This one step leads inevitably to the rationing of imports, to control  over domestic production that uses imported products or that produces  substitutes for imports, and so on in a never-ending spiral. Yet even so generally  staunch a champion of free enterprise as Senator Barry Goldwater has at times  been led, when discussing the so-called ""gold flow,"" to suggest that restrictions  on transactions in foreign exchange may be necessary as a ""cure."" This ""cure""  would be vastly worse than the disease.   There is seldom anything truly new under the sun in economic policy,  where the allegedly new generally turns out to be the discard of a prior century  in flimsy disguise. Unless I am mistaken, however, full-fledged exchange controls  and so-called ""inconvertibility of currencies"" are an exception and their origin  reveals their authoritarian promise. To the best of my knowledge they were  invented by Hjalmar Schacht in the early years of the Nazi regime. On many  occasions in the past, of course, currencies have been described as inconvertible.    53     But what the word then meant was that the government of the day was  unwilling or unable to convert paper currency into gold or silver, or whatever the  monetary commodity was, at the legally stipulated rate. It seldom meant that a  country prohibited its citizens or residents from trading pieces of paper promising  to pay specified sums in the monetary unit of that country for corresponding  pieces of paper expressed in the monetary unit of another country or for that  matter for coin or bullion. During the Civil War in the United States and for a  decade and a half thereafter, for example, U.S. currency was inconvertible in the  sense that the holder of a greenback could not turn it in to the Treasury and get  a fixed amount of gold for it. But throughout the period he was free to buy gold  at the market price or to buy and sell British pounds for U.S. greenbacks at any  price mutually agreeable to the two parties.   In the United States, the dollar has been inconvertible in the older sense  ever since 1933. It has been illegal for American citizens to hold gold or to buy  and sell gold. The dollar has not been inconvertible in the newer sense. But  unfortunately we seem to be adopting policies that are highly likely, sooner or  later, to drive us in that direction.   The Role of Gold in the U.S. Monetary System   Only a cultural lag leads us still to think of gold as the central element in  our monetary system. A more accurate description of the role of gold in U.S.  policy is that it is primarily a commodity whose price is supported, like wheat or  other agricultural products. Our price-support program for gold differs in three  important respects from our price-support program for wheat: first, we pay the  support price to foreign as well as domestic producers; second, we sell freely at  the support price only to foreign purchasers and not to domestic; third, and this  is the one important relic of the monetary role of gold, the Treasury is authorized  to create money to pay for gold it buys to print paper money as it were so that  expenditures for the purchase of gold do not appear in the budget and the sums  required need not be explicitly appropriated by Congress; similarly, when the  Treasury sells gold, the books show simply a reduction in gold certificates, and  not a receipt that enters into the budget.   When the price of gold was first set at its present level of $ 35 an ounce  in 1934, this price was well above the free market price of gold. In consequence,  gold flooded the United States, our gold stock tripled in six years, and we came  to hold well over half the world's gold stock. We accumulated a ""surplus"" of gold  for the same reason we accumulated a ""surplus"" of wheat because the  government offered to pay a higher price than the market price. More recently,  the situation has changed. While the legally fixed price of gold has remained $  35, prices of other goods have doubled or tripled. Hence $ 35 is now less than  what the free market price would be. 1 As a result, we now face a ""shortage""    54     rather than a ""surplus"" for precisely the same reason that rent ceilings inevitably  produce a ""shortage"" of housing because the government is trying to hold the  price of gold below the market price.   The legal price of gold would long since have been raised as wheat prices  have been raised from time to time except for the accident that the major  producers of gold, and hence the major beneficiaries from a rise in its price, are  Soviet Russia and South Africa, the two countries with whom the United States  has least political sympathy.   Governmental control of the price of gold, no less than the control of any  other price, is inconsistent with a free economy. Such a pseudo gold standard  must be distinguished sharply from the use of gold as money under a real gold  standard which is entirely consistent with a free economy though it may not be  feasible. Even more than the price fixing itself, the associated measures taken in  1933 and 1934 by the Roosevelt administration when it raised the price of gold  represented a fundamental departure from liberal principles and established  precedents that have returned to plague the free world. I refer to the  nationalization of the gold stock, the prohibition of private possession of gold for  monetary purposes, and the abrogation of gold clauses in public and private  contracts.   In 1933 and early 1934, private holders of gold were required by law to  turn over their gold to the federal government. They were compensated at a  price equal to the prior legal price, which was at the time decidedly below the  market price. To make this requirement effective, private ownership of gold  within the U.S. was made illegal except for use in the arts. One can hardly  imagine a measure more destructive of the principles of private property on  which a free enterprise society rests. There is no difference in principle between  this nationalization of gold at an artificially low price and Fidel Castro's  nationalization of land and factories at an artificially low price. On what grounds  of principle can the U.S. object to the one after having itself engaged in the  other? Yet so great is the blindness of some supporters of free enterprise with  respect to anything touching gold that in 1960 Henry Alexander, head of the  Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, successor to J . P. Morgan and Company,  proposed that the prohibition against the private ownership of gold by U.S.  citizens be extended to cover gold held abroad! And his proposal was adopted by  President Eisenhower with hardly a protest from the banking community.   Though rationalized in terms of ""conserving"" gold for monetary use,  prohibition of private ownership of gold was not enacted for any such monetary  purpose, whether itself good or bad. The nationalization of gold was enacted to  enable the government to reap the whole of the ""paper"" profit from the rise in  the price of gold or perhaps, to prevent private individuals from benefiting.    55     The abrogation of the gold clauses had a similar purpose. And this too  was a measure destructive of the basic principles of free enterprise. Contracts  entered into in good faith and with full knowledge on the part of both parties to  them were declared invalid for the benefit of one of the parties!   Current Payments and Capital Flight   In discussing international monetary relations on a more general level, it  is necessary to distinguish two rather different problems: the balance of  payments, and the danger of a run on gold. The difference between the  problems can be illustrated most simply by considering the analogy of an  ordinary commercial bank. The bank must so arrange its affairs that it takes in as  service charges, interest on loans, and so on a large enough sum to enable it to  pay its expenses wages and salaries, interest on borrowed funds, cost of  supplies, returns to stockholders, and so on. It must strive, that is, for a healthy  income account. But a bank which is in good shape on its income account may  nonetheless experience serious trouble if for any reason its depositors should  lose confidence in it and suddenly demand their deposits en masse. Many a  sound bank was forced to close its doors because of such a run on it during the  liquidity crises described in the preceding chapter.   These two problems are not of course unrelated. One important reason  why a bank's depositors may lose confidence in it is because the bank is  experiencing losses on income account. Yet the two problems are also very  different. For one thing, problems on income account are generally slow to arise  and considerable time is available to solve them. They seldom come as sudden  surprises. A run, on the other hand, may arise suddenly and unpredictably out of  thin air.   The situation of the U.S. is precisely parallel. Residents of the United  States and the U.S. government itself are seeking to buy foreign currencies with  dollars in order to purchase goods and services in other countries, to invest in  foreign enterprises, to pay interest on debts, to repay loans, or to give gifts to  others, whether private or public. At the same time, foreigners are seeking to  acquire dollars with foreign currencies for corresponding purposes. After the  event, the number of dollars spent for foreign currency will precisely equal the  number of dollars purchased with foreign currency just as the number of pairs of  shoes sold is precisely equal to the number bought. Arithmetic is arithmetic and  one man's purchase is another man's sale. But there is nothing to assure that, at  any given price of foreign currency in terms of dollars, the number of dollars that  some want to spend will equal the number others want to buy just as there is  nothing to assure that at any given price of shoes the number of pairs of shoes  people want to buy is exactly equal to the number of pairs other people want to    56     sell. The ex post equality reflects some mechanism that eliminates any ex ante  discrepancy. The problem of achieving an appropriate mechanism for this  purpose is the counterpart of the bank's problem on income account.   In addition, the United States has a problem like the bank's of avoiding a  run. The U.S. is committed to sell gold to foreign central banks and governments  at $ 35 an ounce. Foreign central banks, governments, and residents hold large  funds in the United States in the form of deposit accounts or U.S. securities that  can be readily sold for dollars. At any time, the holders of these balances can  start a run on the U.S. Treasury by trying to convert their dollar balances into  gold. This is precisely what happened in the fall of 1960, and what is very likely  to happen again at some unpredictable date in the future (perhaps before this is  printed).   The two problems are related in two ways. In the first place, as for a  bank, income account difficulties are a major source of loss of confidence in the  ability of the U.S. to honor its promise to sell gold at $ 35 an ounce. The fact  that the U.S. has in effect been having to borrow abroad in order to achieve  balance on current account is a major reason why holders of dollars are  interested in converting them into gold or other currencies. In the second place,  the fixed price of gold is the device we have adopted for pegging another set of  prices the price of the dollar in terms of foreign currencies and flows of gold are  the device we have adopted for resolving ex ante discrepancies in the balance of  payments.   Alternative Mechanisms for Achieving Balance in Foreign Payments   We can get more light on both of these relations by considering what  alternative mechanisms are available for achieving balance in payments the first  and in many ways the more fundamental of the two problems.   Suppose that the U.S. is roughly in balance in its international payments  and that something comes along which alters the situation by, let us say,  reducing the number of dollars that foreigners want to buy compared to the  number that U.S. residents want to sell; or, looking at it from the other side,  increasing the amount of foreign currency that holders of dollars want to buy  compared to the amount that holders of foreign currency want to sell for dollars.  That is, something threatens to produce a ""deficit"" in U.S. payments. This might  result from increased efficiency in production abroad or decreased efficiency at  home, increased foreign aid expenditures by the U.S. or reduced ones by other  countries, or a million and one other changes of the kind that are always  occurring.    57     There are four, and only four ways, in which a country can adjust to such  a disturbance and some combination of these ways must be used.   1. U.S. reserves of foreign currencies can be drawn down or foreign  reserves of U.S. currency built up. In practice, this means that the U.S.  government can let its stock of gold go down, since gold is exchangeable for  foreign currencies, or it can borrow foreign currencies and make them available  for dollars at official exchange rates; or foreign governments can accumulate  dollars by selling U.S. residents foreign currencies at official rates. Reliance on  reserves is obviously at best a temporary expedient. Indeed, it is precisely the  extensive use by the U.S. of this expedient that accounts for the great concern  with the balance of payments.   2. Domestic prices within the U.S. can be forced down relative to foreign  prices. This is the main adjustment mechanism under a full-fledged gold  standard. An initial deficit would produce an outflow of gold (mechanism 1,  above); the outflow of gold would produce a decline in the stock of money; the  decline in the stock of money would produce a fall in prices and incomes at  home. At the same time, the reverse effects would occur abroad: the inflow of  gold would expand the stock of money and thereby raise prices and income.  Lowered U.S. prices and increased foreign prices would make U.S. goods more  attractive to foreigners and thereby raise the number of dollars they wanted to  buy; at the same time, the price changes would make foreign goods less  attractive to U.S. residents and thereby lower the number of dollars they wanted  to sell. Both effects would operate to reduce the deficit and restore balance  without the necessity for further gold flows.   Under the modern managed standard, these effects are not automatic.  Gold flows may still occur as the first step, but they will not affect the stock of  money in
either the country that loses, or the country that gains gold, unless the  monetary authorities in the separate countries decide that they should. In every  country today, the central bank or the Treasury has the power to offset the  influence of gold flows, or to change the stock of money without gold flows.  Hence this mechanism will be used only if the authorities in the country  experiencing the deficit are willing to produce a deflation, thereby creating  unemployment, in order to resolve its payments problem, or the authorities in  the country experiencing the surplus are willing to produce an inflation.   3. Exactly the same effects can be achieved by a change in exchange  rates as by a change in domestic prices. For example, suppose that under  mechanism 2 the price of a particular car in the United States fell by 10 per cent  from $ 2,800 to $ 2,520. If the price of the pound is throughout $ 2.80, this  means that the price in Britain (neglecting freight and other charges) would fall  from 1, 000 to 900. Exactly the same decline in the British price will occur    58     without any change in the United States price if the price of a pound rises from $  2.80 to $ 3.11. Formerly, the Englishman had to spend 1,000 to get $ 2,800.  Now he can get $ 2,800 for only 900. He would not know the difference  between this reduction in cost and the corresponding reduction through a fall in  the U.S. price without a change in exchange rate.   In practice, there are several ways in which the change in exchange rates  can occur. With the kinds of pegged exchange rates many countries now have, it  can occur through devaluation or appreciation, which is to say, a governmental  declaration that it is changing the price at which it proposes to peg its currency.  Alternatively, the exchange rate docs not need to be pegged at all. It can be a  market rate changing from day to day, as was the case with the Canadian dollar  from 1950 to 1962. If a market rate, it can be a truly free market rate  determined primarily by private transactions as the Canadian rate apparently was  from 1952 to 1961, or it can be manipulated by government speculation as was  the situation in Britain from 1931 to 1939, and in Canada from 1950 to 1952 and  again from 1961 to 1962.   Of these various techniques, only the freely floating exchange rate is fully  automatic and free from governmental control.   4. The adjustments produced by mechanisms 2 and 3 consist of changes  in flows of commodities and services induced by changes either in internal prices  or exchange rates. Instead, direct governmental controls or interferences with  trade could be used to reduce attempted U.S. expenditures of dollars and  expand U.S. receipts. Tariffs could be raised to choke off imports, subsidies could  be given to stimulate exports, import quotas could be imposed on a variety of  goods, capital investment abroad by U.S. citizens or firms could be controlled,  and so on and on up to the whole paraphernalia of exchange controls. In this  category must be included not only controls over private activities but also  changes in governmental programs for balance of payments purposes. Recipients  of foreign aid may be required to spend the aid in the U.S.; the military may  procure goods in the United States at greater expense instead of abroad in order  to save ""dollars"" in the self-contradictory terminology used and so on in  bewildering array.   The important thing to note is that one or another of these four ways will  and must be used. Double entry books must balance. Payments must equal  receipts. The only question is how.   Our announced national policy has been and continues to be that we shall  do none of these things. In a speech in December 1961, to the National  Association of Manufacturers, President Kennedy stated ""This administration,  therefore, during its term of office and I repeat this and make it as a flat    59     statement has no intention of imposing exchange controls, devaluing the dollar,  raising trade barriers or choking off our economic recovery."" As a matter of logic,  this leaves only two possibilities: getting other countries to take the relevant  measures, which is hardly a recourse that we can be sure of, or drawing down  reserves, which the President and other officials repeatedly stated must not be  permitted to continue. Yet Time magazine reports that the President's ""promise  drew a burst of applause"" from the assembled businessmen. So far as our  announced policy is concerned, we are in the position of a man living beyond his  income who insists that he cannot possibly earn more, or spend less, or borrow,  or finance the excess out of his assets!   Because we have been unwilling to adopt any one coherent policy, we and  our trading partners who make the same ostrich-like pronouncements as we do  have perforce been led to resort to all four mechanisms. In the early postwar  years, U.S. reserves rose; more recently they have been declining. We welcomed  inflation more readily than we otherwise would have when reserves were rising,  and we have been more deflationary since 1958 than we would otherwise have  been because of the drain of gold. Though we have not changed our official  price of gold, our trading partners have changed theirs, and thereby the  exchange rate between their currency and the dollar, and U.S. pressure has not  been absent in producing these adjustments. Finally, our trading partners used  direct controls extensively and, since we instead of they have been faced with  deficits, we too have resorted to a wide range of direct interferences with  payments, from reducing the amount of foreign goods that tourists can bring in  free of duty a trivial yet highly symptomatic step to requiring foreign aid  expenditures to be spent in the U.S., to keeping families from joining servicemen  overseas, to more stringent import quotas on oil. We have been led also to  engage in the demeaning step of asking foreign governments to take special  measures to strengthen the U.S. balance of payments.   Of the four mechanisms, the use of direct controls is clearly the worst  from almost any point of view and certainly the most destructive of a free  society. Yet in lieu of any clear policy, we have been led increasingly to rely on  such controls in one form or another. We preach publicly the virtues of free  trade; yet we have been forced by the inexorable pressure of the balance of  payments to move in the opposite direction and there is great danger that we  shall move still farther. We can pass all the laws imaginable to reduce tariffs; the  Administration may negotiate any number of tariff reductions; yet unless we  adopt an alternative mechanism for resolving balance of payments deficits, we  shall be led to substitute one set of trade impediments for another indeed, to  substitute a worse set for a better. While tariffs are bad, quotas and other direct  interferences are even worse. A tariff, like a market price, is impersonal and does  not involve direct interference by government in business affairs; a quota is likely  to involve allocation and other administrative interferences, besides giving    60     administrators valuable plums to pass out to private interests. Perhaps worse  than either tariffs or quotas are extra-legal arrangements, such as the  ""voluntary"" agreement by Japan to restrict textile exports.   Floating Exchange Rates as the Free Market Solution   There are only two mechanisms that are consistent with a free market  and free trade. One is a fully automatic international gold standard. This, as we  saw in the preceding chapter, is neither feasible nor desirable. In any event, we  cannot adopt it by ourselves. The other is a system of freely floating exchange  rates determined in the market by private transactions without governmental  intervention. This is the proper free market counterpart to the monetary rule  advocated in the preceding chapter. If we do not adopt it, we shall inevitably fail  to expand the area of free trade and shall sooner or later be induced to impose  widespread direct controls over trade. In this area, as in others, conditions can  and do change unexpectedly. It may well be that we shall muddle through the  difficulties that are facing us as this is written (April, 1962) and indeed that we  may find ourselves in a surplus rather than deficit position, accumulating  reserves rather than losing them. If so, this will only mean that other countries  will be faced with the necessity of imposing controls. When, in 1950, I wrote an  article proposing a system of floating exchange rates, it was in the context of  European payments difficulties accompanying the then alleged ""dollar shortage.""  Such a turnabout is always possible. Indeed, it is the very difficulty of predicting  when and how such changes occur that is the basic argument for a free market.  Our problem is not to ""solve"" a balance of payments problem. It is to solve the  balance of payments problem by adopting a mechanism that will enable free  market forces to provide a prompt, effective, and automatic response to changes  in conditions affecting international trade.   Though freely floating exchange rates seem so clearly to be the  appropriate free-market mechanism, they are strongly supported only by a fairly  small number of liberals, mostly professional economists, and are opposed by  many liberals who reject governmental intervention and governmental price  fixing in almost every other area. Why is this so? One reason is simply the  tyranny of the status quo. A second reason is the confusion between a real gold  standard and a pseudo gold standard. Under a real gold standard, the prices of  different national currencies in terms of one another would be very nearly rigid  since the different currencies would simply be different names for different  amounts of gold. It is easy to make the mistake of supposing that we can get  the substance of the real gold standard by the mere adoption of the form of a  nominal obeisance to gold the adoption of a pseudo gold standard under which  the prices of different national currencies in terms of one another are rigid only  because they are pegged prices in rigged markets. A third reason is the  inevitable tendency for everyone to be in favor of a free market for everyone    61     else, while regarding himself as deserving of special treatment. This particularly  affects bankers in respect of exchange rates. They like to have a guaranteed  price. Moreover, they are not familiar with the market devices that would arise to  cope with fluctuations in exchange rates. The firms that would specialize in  speculation and arbitrage in a free market for exchange do not exist. This is one  way the tyranny of the status quo is enforced. In Canada, for example, some  bankers, after a decade of a free rate which gave them a different status quo,  were in the forefront of those favoring its continuation and objecting to either a  pegged rate or government manipulation of the rate.   More important than any of these reasons, I believe, is a mistaken  interpretation of experience with floating rates, arising out of a statistical fallacy  that can be seen easily in a standard example. Arizona is clearly the worst place  in the U.S. for a person with tuberculosis to go because the death rate from  tuberculosis is higher in Arizona than in any other state. The fallacy is in this  case obvious. It is less obvious in connection with exchange rates. When  countries have gotten into severe financial difficulties through internal monetary  mismanagement or for any other reason, they have had ultimately to resort to  flexible exchange rates. No amount of exchange control or direct restrictions on  trade enabled them to peg an exchange rate that was far out of line with  economic realities. In consequence, it is unquestionably true that floating  exchange rates have frequently been associated with financial and economic  instability as, for example, in hyperinflations, or severe but not hyperinflations  such as have occurred in many South American countries. It is easy to conclude,  as many have, that floating exchange rates produce such instability.   Being in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor of  unstable exchange rates. When we support a free price system at home, this  does not imply that we favor a system in which prices fluctuate wildly up and  down. What we want is a system in which prices are free to fluctuate but in  which the forces determining them are sufficiently stable so that in fact prices  move within moderate ranges. This is equally true of a system of floating  exchange rates. The ultimate objective is a world in which exchange rates, while  free to vary, are, in fact, highly stable because basic economic policies and  conditions are stable. Instability of exchange rates is a symptom of instability in  the underlying economic structure. Elimination of this symptom by administrative  freezing of exchange rates cures none of the underlying difficulties and only  makes adjustments to them more painful.   The Policy Measures Necessary for a Free Market in Gold and Foreign  Exchange    62     It may help bring out in concrete terms the implications of this discussion  if I specify in detail the measures that I believe the U.S. should take to promote  a truly free market in both gold and foreign exchange.   1. The U.S. should announce that it no longer commits itself to buy or sell  gold at any fixed price.   2. Present laws making it illegal for individuals to own gold or to buy and  sell gold should be repealed, so that there are no restrictions on the price at  which gold can be bought or sold in terms of any other commodity or financial  instrument, including national currencies.   3. The present law specifying that the Reserve System must hold gold  certificates equal to 25 per cent of its liabilities should be repealed.   4. A major problem in getting rid completely of the gold price-support  program, as of the wheat price-support program, is the transitional one of what  to do with accumulated government stocks. In both cases, my own view is that  the government should immediately restore a free market by instituting steps 1  and 2, and should ultimately dispose of all of its stocks. However, it would  probably be desirable for the government to dispose of its stocks only gradually.  For wheat, five years has always seemed to me a long enough period, so I have  favored the government committing itself to dispose of one-fifth of its stocks in  each of five years. This period seems reasonably satisfactory for gold as well.  Hence, I propose that the government auction off its gold stocks on the free  market over a five-year period. With a free gold market, individuals may well find  warehouse certificates for gold more useful than actual gold. But if so, private  enterprise can certainly provide the service of storing the gold and issuing  certificates. Why should gold storage and the issuance of warehouse certificates  be a nationalized industry?   5. The U.S. should announce also that it will not proclaim any official  exchange rates between the dollar and other currencies and in addition that it  will not engage in any speculative or other activities aimed at influencing  exchange rates. These would then be determined in free markets.   6. These measures would conflict with our formal obligation as a member  of the International Monetary Fund to specify an official parity for the dollar.  However, the Fund found it possible to reconcile Canada's failure to specify a  parity with its Articles and to give its approval to a floating rate for Canada.  There is no reason why it cannot do the same for the U.S.   7. Other nations might choose to peg their currencies to the dollar. That is  their business and there is no reason for us to object so long as we undertake no    63     obligations to buy or sell their currency at a fixed price. They will be able to  succeed in pegging their currency to ours only by one or more of the measures  listed earlier drawing on or accumulating reserves, coordinating their internal  policy with U.S. policy, tightening or loosening direct controls on trade.   Eliminating
U.S. Restrictions on Trade   A system such as that just outlined would solve the balance of payments  problem once and for all. No deficit could possibly arise to require high  government officials to plead with foreign countries and central banks for  assistance, or to require an American President to behave like a harried country  banker trying to restore confidence in his bank, or to force an administration  preaching free trade to impose import restrictions, or to sacrifice important  national and personal interests to the trivial question of the name of the currency  in which payments are made. Payments would always balance because a price  the foreign exchange rate would be free to produce a balance. No one could sell  dollars unless he could find someone to buy them and conversely.   A system of floating exchange rates would therefore enable us to proceed  effectively and directly toward complete free trade in goods and services barring  only such deliberate interference as may be justified on strictly political and  military grounds; for example, banning the sale of strategic goods to communist  countries. So long as we are firmly committed to the strait jacket of fixed  exchange rates, we cannot move definitively to free trade. The possibility of  tariffs or direct controls must be retained as an escape valve in case of necessity.   A system of floating exchange rates has the side advantage that it makes  almost transparently obvious the fallacy in the most popular argument against  free trade, the argument that ""low"" wages elsewhere make tariffs somehow  necessary to protect ""high"" wages here. Is 100 yen an hour to a Japanese  worker high or low compared with $ 4 an hour to an American worker? That all  depends on the exchange rate. What determines the exchange rate? The  necessity of making payments balance; i.e., of making the amount we can sell to  the J apanese roughly equal to the amount they can sell to us.   Suppose for simplicity that Japan and the U.S. are the only two countries  involved in trade and that at some exchange rate, say 1,000 yen to the dollar,  Japanese could produce every single item capable of entering into foreign trade  more cheaply than the U.S. At that exchange rate the Japanese could sell much  to us, we, nothing to them. Suppose we pay them in paper dollars. What would  the Japanese exporters do with the dollars? They cannot eat them, wear them,  or live in them. If they were willing simply to hold them, then the printing  industry printing the dollar bills would be a magnificent export industry. Its    64     output would enable us all to have the good things of life provided nearly free by  the J apanese.   But, of course, Japanese exporters would not want to hold the dollars.  They would want to sell them for yen. By assumption, there is nothing they can  buy for a dollar that they cannot buy for less than the 1,000 yen that a dollar will  by assumption exchange for. This is equally true for other Japanese. Why then  would any holder of yen give up 1,000 yen for a dollar that will buy less in goods  than the 1,000 yen will? No one would. In order for the Japanese exporter to  exchange his dollars for yen, he would have to offer to take fewer yen the price  of the dollar in terms of the yen would have to be less than 1, 000, or of the yen  in terms of the dollar more than I mill. But at 500 yen to the dollar Japanese  goods are twice as expensive to Americans as before; American goods half as  expensive to the Japanese. The Japanese will no longer be able to undersell  American producers on all items.   Where will the price of the yen in terms of dollars settle? At whatever  level is necessary to assure that all exporters who desire to do so can sell the  dollars they get for the goods they export to America to importers who use them  to buy goods in America. To speak loosely, at whatever level is necessary to  assure that the value of U.S. exports (in dollars) is equal to the value of U.S.  imports (again in dollars). Loosely, because a precise statement would have to  take into account capital transactions, gifts, and so on. But these do not alter the  central principle.   It will be noted that this discussion says nothing about the level of living  of the Japanese worker or the American worker. These are irrelevant. If the  Japanese worker has a lower standard of living than the American, it is because   he is less productive on the average than the American, given the training he   has, the amount of capital and land and so on that he has to work with. If the  American worker is, let us say, on the average four times as productive as the  Japanese worker, it is wasteful to use him to produce any goods in the   production of which he is less than four times as productive. It is better to   produce those goods at which he is more productive and trade them for the  goods at which he is less productive. Tariffs do not assist the J apanese worker to  raise his standard of living or protect the high standard of the American worker.  On the contrary, they lower the Japanese standard and keep the American  standard from being as high as it could be.   Given that we should move to free trade, how should we do so? The  method that we have tried to adopt is reciprocal negotiation of tariff reductions  with other countries. This seems to me a wrong procedure. In the first place, it  ensures a slow pace. He moves fastest who moves alone. In the second place, it  fosters an erroneous view of the basic problem. It makes it appear as if tariffs    65     help the country imposing them but hurt other countries, as if when we reduce a  tariff we give up something good and should get something in return in the form  of a reduction in the tariffs imposed by other countries. In truth, the situation is  quite different. Our tariffs hurt us as well as other countries. We would be  benefited by dispensing with our tariffs even if other countries did not. 2 We  would of course be benefited even more if they reduced theirs but our benefiting  does not require that they reduce theirs. Self interests coincide and do not  conflict.   I believe that it would be far better for us to move to free trade  unilaterally, as Britain did in the nineteenth century when it repealed the corn  laws. We, as they did, would experience an enormous accession of political and  economic power. We are a great nation and it ill behooves us to require  reciprocal benefits from Luxembourg before we reduce a tariff on Luxembourg  products, or to throw thousands of Chinese refugees suddenly out of work by  imposing import quotas on textiles from Hong Kong. Let us live up to our destiny  and set the pace not be reluctant followers.   I have spoken in terms of tariffs for simplicity but, as already noted, non-  tariff restrictions may now be more serious impediments to trade than tariffs. We  should remove both. A prompt yet gradual program would be to legislate that all  import quotas or other quantitative restrictions, whether imposed by us or  ""voluntarily"" accepted by other countries, be raised 20 per cent a year until they  are so high that they become irrelevant and can be abandoned, and that all  tariffs be reduced by one-tenth of the present level in each of the next ten years.   There are few measures we could take that would do more to promote  the cause of freedom at home and abroad. Instead of making grants to foreign  governments in the name of economic aid and thereby promoting socialism while  at the same time imposing restrictions on the products they succeed in  producing and thereby hindering free enterprise we could assume a consistent  and principled stance. We could say to the rest of the world: We believe in  freedom and intend to practice it. No one can force you to be free. That is your  business. But we can offer you full co-operation on equal terms to all. Our  market is open to you. Sell here what you can and wish to. Use the proceeds to  buy what you wish. In this way co-operation among individuals can be world  wide yet free. ",Capitalism and Freedom  International Financial and Trade Arrangements,"This chapter advocates the end of the Bretton Woods system in favor of a floating exchange rate system and the end of all currency controls and trade barriers, even ""voluntary"" export quotas. Friedman says that this is the only true solution to the balance of trades problem."
"Ever since the new deal, a primary excuse for the expansion of  governmental activity at the federal level has been the supposed necessity for  government spending to eliminate unemployment. The excuse has gone through  several stages. At first, government spending was needed to ""prime the pump.""  Temporary expenditures would set the economy going and the government  could then step out of the picture.   When the initial expenditures failed to eliminate unemployment and were  followed by a sharp economic contraction in 193738, the theory of ""secular  stagnation"" developed to justify a permanently high level of government  spending. The economy had become mature, it was argued. Opportunities for  investment had been largely exploited and no substantial new opportunities were  likely to arise. Yet individuals would still want to save. Hence, it was essential for  government to spend and run a perpetual deficit. The securities issued to finance  the deficit would provide individuals with a way to accumulate savings while the  government expenditures provided employment. This view has been thoroughly  discredited by theoretical analysis and even more by actual experience, including  the emergence of wholly new lines for private investment not dreamed of by the  secular stagnationists. Yet it has left its heritage. The idea may be accepted by  none, but the government programs undertaken in its name, like some of those  intended to prime the pump, are still with us and indeed account for ever-  growing government expenditures.   More recently, the emphasis has been on government expenditures  neither to prime the pump nor to hold in check the specter of secular stagnation  but as a balance wheel. When private expenditures decline for any reason, it is  said, governmental expenditures should rise to keep total expenditures stable;  conversely, when private expenditures rise, governmental expenditures should  decline. Unfortunately, the balance wheel is unbalanced. Each recession,  however minor, sends a shudder through politically sensitive legislators and  administrators with their ever present fear that perhaps it is the harbinger of  another 192933. They hasten to enact federal spending programs of one kind or  another. Many of the programs do not in fact come into effect until after the  recession has passed. Hence, insofar as they do affect total expenditures, on  which I shall have more to say later, they tend to exacerbate the succeeding  expansion rather than to mitigate the recession. The haste with which spending  programs are approved is not matched by an equal haste to repeal them or to  eliminate others when the recession is passed and expansion is under way. On  the contrary, it is then argued that a ""healthy"" expansion must not be    67     ""jeopardized"" by cuts in governmental expenditures. The chief harm done by the  balance-wheel theory is therefore not that it has failed to offset recessions,  which it has, and not that it has introduced an inflationary bias into  governmental policy, which it has done too, but that it has continuously fostered  an expansion in the range of governmental activities at the federal level and  prevented a reduction in the burden of federal taxes.   In view of the emphasis on using the federal budget as a balance wheel, it  is ironic that the most unstable component of national income in the postwar  period is federal expenditure, and the instability has not at all been in a direction  to offset movements of other expenditure components. Far from being a balance  wheel offsetting other forces making for fluctuations, the federal budget has if  anything been itself a major source of disturbance and instability.   Because its expenditures are now so large a part of the total for the  economy as a whole, the federal government cannot avoid having significant  effects on the economy. The first requisite is therefore that the government  mend its own fences, that it adopt procedures that will lead to reasonable  stability in its own flow of expenditures. If it would do that, it would make a clear  contribution to reducing the adjustments required in the rest of the economy.  Until it does that, it is farcical for government officials to adopt the self-righteous  tones of the schoolmaster keeping unruly pupils in line. Of course, their doing so  is not surprising. Passing the buck and blaming others for one's own deficiencies  are not vices of which governmental officials have a monopoly.   Even if one were to accept the view that the federal budget should be and  can be used as a balance wheel a view I shall consider in more detail below  there is no necessity to use the expenditure side of the budget for this purpose.  The tax side is equally available. A decline in national income automatically  reduces the tax revenue of the federal government in greater proportion and  thus shifts the budget in the direction of a deficit, and conversely during a boom.  If it is desired to do more, taxes can be lowered during recessions and raised  during expansions. Of course, politics might well enforce an asymmetry here too,  making the declines politically more palatable than the rises.   If the balance-wheel theory has in practice been applied on the  expenditure side, it has been because of the existence of other forces making for  increased governmental expenditures; in particular, the widespread acceptance  by intellectuals of the belief that government should play a larger role in  economic and private affairs; the triumph, that is, of the philosophy of the  welfare state. This philosophy has found a useful ally in the balance-wheel  theory; it has enabled governmental intervention to proceed at a faster pace  than would otherwise have been possible.    68     How different matters might now be if the balance-wheel theory had been  applied on the tax side instead of the expenditure side. Suppose each recession  had seen a cut in taxes and suppose the political unpopularity of raising taxes in  the succeeding expansion had led to resistance to newly proposed governmental  expenditure programs and to curtailment of existing ones. We might now be in a  position where federal expenditures would be absorbing a good deal less of a  national income that would be larger because of the reduction in the depressing  and inhibiting effects of taxes.   I hasten to add that this dream is not intended to indicate support for the  balance-wheel theory. In practice, even if the effects would be in the direction  expected under the balance wheel theory, they would be delayed in time and  spread. To make them an effective offset to other forces making for fluctuations,  we would have to be able to forecast those fluctuations a long time in advance.  In fiscal policy as in monetary policy, all political considerations aside, we simply  do not know enough to be able to use deliberate changes in taxation or  expenditures as a sensitive stabilizing mechanism. In the process of trying to do  so, we almost surely make matters worse. We make matters worse not by being  consistently perverse that would be easily cured by simply doing the opposite of  what seemed at first the thing to do. We make matters worse by introducing a  largely random disturbance that is simply added to other disturbances. That is  what we seem in fact to have done in the past in addition, of course to the major  mistakes that have been seriously perverse. What I have written elsewhere in  respect of monetary policy is equally applicable to fiscal policy: ""What we need is  not a skillful monetary driver of the economic vehicle continuously turning the  steering wheel to adjust to the unexpected irregularities of the route, but some  means of keeping the monetary passenger who is in the back seat as ballast  from occasionally leaning over and giving the steering wheel a jerk that  threatens to send the car off the road ."" 1   For fiscal policy, the appropriate counterpart to the monetary rule would  be to plan expenditure programs entirely in terms of what the community wants  to do through government rather than privately, and without any regard to  problems of year-to-year economic stability; to plan tax rates so as to provide  sufficient revenues to cover planned expenditures on the average of one year  with another, again without regard to year-to-year changes in economic stability;  and to avoid erratic changes in either governmental expenditures or taxes. Of  course, some changes may be unavoidable. A sudden change in the international  situation may dictate large increases in military expenditures or permit welcome  decreases. Such changes account for some erratic shifts in federal expenditures  in the postwar period. But they by no means account for all.   Before leaving the subject of fiscal policy, I should like to discuss the view,  now so widely held, that an increase in governmental expenditures relative to    69     tax-receipts is necessarily expansionary and a decrease contractionary. This  view, which is at the heart of the belief that fiscal policy can serve as a balance  wheel, is by now almost taken for granted by businessmen, professional  economists, and laymen alike. Yet it cannot be demonstrated to be true by  logical considerations alone, has never been documented by empirical evidence,  and is in fact inconsistent with the relevant empirical evidence of which I know.   The belief has its origin in a crude Keynesian analysis. Suppose  governmental expenditures are raised by $ 100 and taxes are kept unchanged.  Then, goes the simple analysis, on the first round, the people who receive the  extra hundred dollars will have that much more income. They will save some of  it, say one-third, and spend the remaining two-thirds. But this means that on the  second round, someone else receives an extra $ 66 2/3 of income. He in turn will   save some and spend some, and so on and on in infinite sequence. If at every   stage one-third is saved and two-thirds spent, then the extra $ 100 of   government expenditures will ultimately, on this analysis, add $ 300 to income.   This is the simple Keynesian multiplier analysis with a multiplier of three. Of  course, if there is one injection, the effects will die off, the initial jump in income  of $ 100 being succeeded by a gradual decline back to the earlier level. But if  government expenditures are kept $ 100 higher per unit of time, say $ 100 a  year higher, then, on this analysis, income will remain higher by $ 300 a year.   This simple analysis is extremely appealing. But the appeal is spurious and  arises from neglecting other relevant effects of the change in question. When  these are taken into account, the final result is much more dubious: it may be  anything from no change in income at all, in which case private expenditures will  go down by the $ 100 by which government expenditures go up, to the full  increase specified. And even if money income increases, prices may rise, so real  income will increase less or not at all. Let us examine some of the possible slips'  twixt cup and lip.   In the first place, nothing is said in the simple account about what the  government spends the $ 100 on. Suppose, for example, it spends it on  something that individuals were otherwise obtaining for themselves. They were,  for example, spending $ 100 on paying fees to a park which paid the cost of  attendants to keep it clean. Suppose the government now pays these costs and  permits people to enter the park ""free."" The attendants still receive the same  income, but the people who paid the fees have $ 100 available. The government  spending does not, even in the initial stage, add $ 100 to anyone's income. What  it does is to leave some people with $ 100 available to use for purposes other  than the park, and presumably purposes they value less highly. They can be  expected to spend less out of their total income for consumer goods than  formerly, since they are receiving the park services free. How much less, it is not  easy to say. Even if we accept, as in the simple analysis, that people save one-    70     third of additional income, it does not follow that when they get one set of  consumer goods ""free,"" two-thirds of the released money will be spent on other  consumer goods. One extreme possibility, of course, is that they will continue to  buy the same collection of other consumer goods as they did before and add the  released $100 to their savings. In this case even in the simple Keynesian  analysis, the effect of the government expenditures is completely offset:  government expenditures go up by $100, private down by $100. Or, to take  another example, the $100 may be spent to build a road that a private enterprise  would otherwise have built or the availability of which may make repairs to the  company's trucks unnecessary. The firm then has funds released, but  presumably will not spend them all on what are less attractive investments. In  these cases, government expenditures simply divert private expenditures and  only the net excess of government expenditures is even available at the outset  for the multiplier to work on. From this point of view, it is paradoxical that the  way to assure no diversion is to have the government spend the money for  something utterly useless this is the limited intellectual content to the ""filling-  holes"" type of make-work. But of course this itself shows that there is something  wrong with the analysis.   In the second place, nothing is said in the simple account about where the  government gets the $ 100 to spend. So far as the analysis goes, the results are  the same whether the government prints extra money or borrows from the  public. But surely which it does will make a difference. To separate fiscal from  monetary policy, let us suppose the government borrows the $ 100 so that the  stock of money is the same as it would have been in the absence of the  government expenditure. This is the proper assumption because the stock of  money can be increased without extra government expenditure, if that is  desired, simply by printing the money and buying outstanding government bonds  with it. But we must now ask what the effect of borrowing is. To analyze this  problem, let us assume that diversion does not occur, so in the first instance  there is no direct offset to the $ 100 in the form of a compensating drop in  private expenditures. Note that the government's borrowing to spend does not  alter the amount of money in private hands. The government borrows $ 100 with  its right hand from some individuals and hands the money with its left hand to  those individuals to whom its expenditures go. Different people hold the money  but the total amount of money held is unchanged.   The simple Keynesian analysis implicitly assumes that borrowing the  money does not have any effects on other spending. There are two extreme  circumstances under which this can occur. First, suppose people are utterly  indifferent to whether they hold bonds or money, so that bonds to get the $ 100  can be sold without having to offer a higher return to the buyer than such bonds  were yielding before. (Of course, $ 100 is so small an amount that it would in  practice have a negligible effect on the required rate of return, but the issue is    71     one of principle whose practical effect can be seen by letting the $ 100 stand for  $ 100 million or $ 100 ten-million.) In Keynesian jargon, there is a ""liquidity trap""  so people buy the bonds with ""idle money."" If this is not the case, and clearly it  cannot be indefinitely, then the government can sell the bonds only by offering a  higher rate of return on it. A higher rate will then have to be paid also by other  borrowers. This higher rate will in general discourage private spending on the  part of would-be borrowers. Here comes the second extreme circumstance under  which the simple Keynesian analysis will hold: if potential borrowers are so  stubborn about spending that no rise in interest rates however steep will cut  down their expenditures, or, in Keynesian jargon, if the marginal efficiency  schedule of investment is perfectly inelastic with respect to the interest rate.   I know of no established economist, no matter how much of a Keynesian  he may 
egard himself as being, who would regard either of these extreme  assumptions as holding currently, or as being capable of holding over any  considerable range of borrowing or rise in interest rates, or as having held  except under rather special circumstances in the past. Yet many an economist,  let alone non-economist, whether regarding himself as Keynesian or not, accepts  as valid the belief that a rise in governmental expenditures relative to tax  receipts, even when financed by borrowing, is necessarily expansionist, though  as we have seen, this belief implicitly requires one of these extreme  circumstances to hold.   If neither assumption holds, the rise in government expenditures will be  offset by a decline in private expenditures on the part either of those who lend  funds to the government, or of those who would otherwise have borrowed the  funds. How much of the rise in expenditures will be offset? This depends on the  holders of money. The extreme assumption, implicit in a rigid quantity theory of  money, is that the amount of money people want to hold depends, on the  average, only on their income and not on the rate of return that they can get on  bonds and similar securities. In this case, since the total stock of money is the  same before and after, the total money income will also have to be the same in  order to make people just satisfied to hold that money stock. This means that  interest rates will have to rise enough to choke off an amount of private  spending exactly equal to the increased public expenditure. In this extreme case,  there is no sense at all in which the government expenditures are expansionary.  Not even money income goes up, let alone real income. All that happens is that  government expenditures go up and private expenditures down.   I warn the reader that this is a highly simplified analysis. A full analysis  would require a lengthy textbook. But even this simplified analysis is enough to  demonstrate that any result is possible between a $ 300 rise in income and a  zero rise. The more stubborn consumers are with respect to how much they will  spend on consumption out of a given income, and the more stubborn purchasers    72     of capital goods are with respect to how much they will spend on such goods  regardless of cost, the nearer the result will be to the Keynesian extreme of a $  300 rise. On the other side, the more stubborn money holders are with respect  to the ratio they wish to maintain between their cash balances and their income,  the closer the result will be to the rigid quantity theory extreme of no change in  income. In which of these respects the public is more stubborn is an empirical  question to be judged from the factual evidence, not something that can be  determined by reason alone.   Before the Great Depression of the 1930's, the bulk of economists would  unquestionably have concluded that the result would be nearer to no rise in  income than to a $ 300 rise. Since then, the bulk of economists would  unquestionably conclude the opposite. More recently, there has been a  movement back toward the earlier position. Sad to say, none of these shifts can  be said to be based on satisfactory evidence. They have been based rather on  intuitive judgments from crude experience.   In co-operation with some of my students, I have done some fairly  extensive empirical work, for the U.S. and other countries, to get some more  satisfactory evidence. 2 The results are striking. They strongly suggest that the  actual outcome will be closer to the quantity theory extreme than to the  Keynesian. The judgement that seems justified on the basis of this evidence is  that the assumed $ 100 increase in government expenditures can on the average  be expected to add just about $ 100 to income, sometimes less, sometimes  more. This means that a rise in government expenditures relative to income is  not expansionary in any relevant sense. It may add to money income but all of  this addition is absorbed by government expenditures. Private expenditures are  unchanged. Since prices are likely to rise in the process, or fall less than they  otherwise would, the effect is to leave private expenditures smaller in real terms.  Converse propositions hold for a decline in government expenditures.   These conclusions cannot of course be regarded as final. They are based  on the broadest and most comprehensive body of evidence I know about, but  that body of evidence still leaves much to be desired.   One thing is however clear. Whether the views so widely accepted about  the effects of fiscal policy be right or wrong, they are contradicted by at least  one extensive body of evidence. I know of no other coherent or organized body  of evidence justifying them. They are part of economic mythology, not the  demonstrated conclusions of economic analysis or quantitative studies. Yet they  have wielded immense influence in securing widespread public backing for far-  reaching governmental interference in economic life. ",Capitalism and Freedom  Fiscal Policy,"Friedman argues against the continual government spending being used to ""balance the wheel"" and help the economy to continue to grow. Federal government expenditures do not make the economy more stable, but have failed to balance out recession, introduced inflation, expanded government control, and failed to lighten tax burdens. Friedman uses concrete evidence from his own research, demonstrating that the rise in government expenditures results in a roughly equal rise in GDP, contrasting with the Keynsian multiplier theory. Many reasons for this discrepancy are discussed."
"Formal schooling is today paid for and almost entirely administered by  government bodies or non-profit institutions. This situation has developed  gradually and is now taken so much for granted that little explicit attention is any  longer directed to the reasons for the special treatment of schooling even in  countries that are predominantly free enterprise in organization and philosophy.  The result has been an indiscriminate extension of governmental responsibility.   In terms of the principles developed in chapter ii, governmental  intervention into education can be rationalized on two grounds. The first is the  existence of substantial ""neighborhood effects,"" i.e., circumstances under which  the action of one individual imposes significant costs on other individuals for  which it is not feasible to make him compensate them, or yields significant gains  to other individuals for which it is not feasible to make them compensate him  circumstances that make voluntary exchange impossible. The second is the  paternalistic concern for children and other irresponsible individuals.  Neighborhood effects and paternalism have very different implications for (1)  general education for citizenship, and (2) specialized vocational education. The  grounds for governmental intervention are widely different in these two areas  and justify very different types of action.   One further preliminary remark: it is important to distinguish between  ""schooling"" and ""education."" Not all schooling is education nor all education,  schooling. The proper subject of concern is education. The activities of  government are mostly limited to schooling.   General Education for Citizenship   A stable and democratic society is impossible without a minimum degree  of literacy and knowledge on the part of most citizens and without widespread  acceptance of some common set of values. Education can contribute to both. In  consequence, the gain from the education of a child accrues not only to the child  or to his parents but also to other members of the society. The education of my  child contributes to your welfare by promoting a stable and democratic society. It  is not feasible to identify the particular individuals (or families) benefited and so  to charge for the services rendered. There is therefore a significant  ""neighborhood effect.""   What kind of governmental action is justified by this particular  neighborhood effect? The most obvious is to require that each child receive a    75     minimum amount of schooling of a specified kind. Such a requirement could be  imposed upon the parents without further government action, just as owners of  buildings, and frequently of automobiles, are required to adhere to specified  standards to protect the safety of others. There is, however, a difference  between the two cases. Individuals who cannot pay the costs of meeting the  standards required for buildings or automobiles can generally divest themselves  of the property by selling it. The requirement can thus generally be enforced  without government subsidy. The separation of a child from a parent who cannot  pay for the minimum required schooling is clearly inconsistent with our reliance  on the family as the basic social unit and our belief in the freedom of the  individual. Moreover, it would be very likely to detract from his education for  citizenship in a free society.   If the financial burden imposed by such a schooling requirement could  readily be met by the great bulk of the families in a community, it might still be  both feasible and desirable to require the parents to meet the cost directly.  Extreme cases could be handled by special subsidy provisions for needy families.  There are many areas in the United States today where these conditions are  satisfied. In these areas, it would be highly desirable to impose the costs directly  on the parents. This would eliminate the governmental machinery now required  to collect tax funds from all residents during the whole of their lives and then pay  it back mostly to the same people during the period when their children are in  school. It would reduce the likelihood that governments would also administer  schools, a matter discussed further below. It would increase the likelihood that  the subsidy component of school expenditures would decline as the need for  such subsidies declined with increasing general levels of income. If, as now, the  government pays for all or most schooling, a rise in income simply leads to a still  larger circular flow of funds through the tax mechanism, and an expansion in the  role of the government. Finally, but by no means least, imposing the costs on the  parents would tend to equalize the social and private costs of having children  and so promote a better distribution of families by size . 1   Differences among families in resources and in number of children, plus  the imposition of a standard of schooling involving very sizable costs, make such  a policy hardly feasible in many parts of the United States. Both in such areas,  and in areas where such a policy would be feasible, government has instead  assumed the financial costs of providing schooling. It has paid, not only for the  minimum amount of schooling required of all, but also for additional schooling at  higher levels available to youngsters but not required of them. One argument for  both steps is the ""neighborhood effects"" discussed above. The costs are paid  because this is the only feasible means of enforcing the required minimum.  Additional schooling is financed because other people benefit from the schooling  of those of greater ability and interest, since this is a way of providing better  social and political leadership. The gain from these measures must be balanced    76     against the costs, and there can be much honest difference of judgment about  how extensive a subsidy is justified. Most of us, however, would probably  conclude that the gains are sufficiently important to justify some government  subsidy.   These grounds justify government subsidy of only certain kinds of  schooling. To anticipate, they do not justify subsidizing purely vocational training  which increases the economic productivity of the student but does not train him  for either citizenship or leadership. It is extremely difficult to draw a sharp line  between the two types of schooling. Most general schooling adds to the  economic value of the studentindeed it is only in modern times and in a few  countries that literacy has ceased to have a marketable value. And much  vocational training broadens the student's outlook. Yet the distinction is  meaningful. Subsidizing the training of veterinarians, beauticians, dentists, and a  host of other specialists, as is widely done in the United States in governmentally  supported educational institutions, cannot be justified on the same grounds as  subsidizing elementary schools or, at a higher level, liberal arts colleges. Whether  it can be justified on quite different grounds will be discussed later in this  chapter.   The qualitative argument from ""neighborhood effects"" does not, of  course, determine the specific kinds of schooling that should be subsidized or by  how much they should be subsidized. The social gain presumably is greatest for  the lowest levels of schooling, where there is the nearest approach to unanimity  about content, and declines continuously as the level of schooling rises. Even this  statement cannot be taken completely for granted. Many governments  subsidized universities long before they subsidized lower schools. What forms of  education have the greatest social advantage and how much of the community's  limited resources should be spent on them must be decided by the judgment of  the community expressed through its accepted political channels. The aim of this  analysis is not to decide these questions for the community but rather to clarify  the issues involved in making a choice, in particular whether it is appropriate to  make the choice on a communal rather than individual basis.   As we have seen, both the imposition of a minimum required level of  schooling and the financing of this schooling by the state can be justified by the  ""neighborhood effects"" of schooling. A third step, namely the actual  administration of educational institutions by the government, the  ""nationalization,"" as it were, of the bulk of the ""education industry"" is much more  difficult to justify on these, or, so far as I can see, any other, grounds. The  desirability of such nationalization has seldom been faced explicitly. Governments  have, in the main, financed schooling by paying directly the costs of running  educational institutions. Thus this step seemed required by the decision to  subsidize schooling. Yet the two steps could readily be separated. Governments    77     could require a minimum level of schooling financed by giving parents vouchers  redeemable for a specified maximum sum per child per year if spent on  ""approved"" educational services. Parents would then be free to spend this sum  and any additional sum they themselves provided on purchasing educational  services from an ""approved"" institution of their own choice. The educational  services could be rendered by private enterprises operated for profit, or by non-  profit institutions. The role of the government would be limited to insuring that  the schools met certain minimum standards, such as the inclusion of a minimum  common content in their programs, much as it now inspects restaurants to  insure that they maintain minimum sanitary standards. An excellent example of a  program of this sort is the United States educational program for veterans after  World War II. Each veteran who qualified was given a maximum sum per year  that could be spent at any institution of his choice, provided it met certain  minimum standards. A more limited example is the provision in Britain whereby  local authorities pay the fees of some students attending non-state schools.  Another is the arrangement in France whereby the state pays part of the costs  for students attending non-state schools.   One argument for nationalizing schools resting on a ""neighborhood effect""  is that it might otherwise be impossible to provide the common core of values  deemed requisite for social stability. The imposition of minimum standards on  privately conducted schools, as suggested above, might not be enough to  achieve this result. The issue can be illustrated concretely in terms of schools run  by different religious groups. Such schools, it can be argued, will instil sets of  values that are inconsistent with one another and with those instilled in non-  sectarian schools; in this way, they convert education into a divisive rather than  a unifying force.   Carried to its extreme, this argument would call not only for  governmentally administered schools, but also for compulsory attendance at  such schools. Existing arrangements in the United States and most other  Western countries are a halfway house. Governmentally administered schools are  available but not compulsory. However, the link between the financing of  schooling and its administration places other schools at a disadvantage: they get  the benefit of little or none of the governmental funds spent on schooling a  situation that has been the source of much political dispute, particularly in France  and at present in the United States. The elimination of this disadvantage might,  it is feared, greatly strengthen the parochial schools and so render the problem  of achieving a common core of values even more difficult.   Persuasive as this argument is, it is by no means clear that it is valid or  that denationalizing schooling would have the effects suggested. On grounds of  principle, it conflicts with the preservation of freedom itself. Drawing a line  between providing for the common social values required for a stable society, on    78     the one hand, and indoctrination inhibiting freedom of thought and belief, on the  other is another of those vague boundaries that is easier to mention than to  define.    In terms of effects, denationalizing schooling would widen the range of  choice available to parents. If, as at present, parents can send their children to  public schools without special payment, very few can or will send them to other  schools unless they too are subsidized. Parochial schools are at a disadvantage in  not getting any of the public funds devoted to schooling, but they have the  compensating advantage of being run by institutions that are willing to subsidize  them and can raise funds to do so. There are few other sources of subsidies for  private schools. If present public expenditures on schooling were made available  to parents regardless of where they send their children, a wide variety of schools  would spring up to meet the demand. Parents could express their views about  schools directly by withdrawing their children from one school and sending them  to another, to a much greater extent than is now possible. In general, they can  now take this step only at considerable cost by sending their children to a private  school or by changing their residence. For the rest, they can express their views  only through cumbrous political channels. Perhaps a somewhat greater degree of  freedom to choose schools could be made available in a governmentally  administered system, but it would be difficult to carry this freedom very far in  view of the obligation to provide every child with a place. Here, as in other fields,  competitive enterprise is likely to be far more efficient in meeting consumer  demand than either nationalized enterprises or enterprises run to serve other  purposes. The final result may therefore be that parochial schools would decline  rather than grow in importance.   A related factor working in the same direction is the understandable  reluctance of parents who send their children to parochial schools to increase  taxes to finance higher public school expenditures. As a result, those areas  where parochial schools are important have great difficulty raising funds for  public schools. Insofar as quality is related to expenditure, as to some extent it  undoubtedly is, public schools tend to be of lower quality in such areas and  hence parochial schools are relatively more attractive.   Another special case of the argument that governmentally conducted  schools are necessary for education to be a unifying force is that private schools  would tend to exacerbate class distinctions. Given greater freedom about where  to send their children, parents of a kind would flock together and so prevent a  healthy intermingling of children from decidedly different backgrounds. Whether  or not this argument is valid in principle, it is not at all clear that the stated  results would follow. Under present arrangements, stratification of residential  areas effectively restricts the intermingling of children from decidedly different  backgrounds. In addition, parents are not now prevented from sending their    79     children to private schools. Only a highly limited class can or does do so,  parochial schools aside, thus producing further stratification.   Indeed, this argument seems to me to point in almost the diametrically  opposite direction toward the denationalizing of schools. Ask yourself in what  respect the inhabitant of a low income neighborhood, let alone of a Negro  neighborhood in a large city, is most disadvantaged. If he attaches enough  importance to, say, a new automobile, he can, by dint of saving, accumulate  enough money to buy the same car as a resident of a high-income suburb. To do  so, he need not move to that suburb. On the contrary, he can get the money  partly by economizing on his living quarters. And this goes equally for clothes, or  furniture, or books, or what not. But let a poor family in a slum have a gifted  child and let it set such high value on his or her schooling that it is willing to  scrimp and save for the purpose. Unless it can get special treatment, or  scholarship assistance, at one of the very few private schools, the family is in a  very difficult position. The ""good"" public schools are in the high income  neighborhoods. The family
might be willing to spend something in addition to  what it pays in taxes to get better schooling for its child. But it can hardly afford  simultaneously to move to the expensive neighborhood.   Our views in these respects are, I believe, still dominated by the small  town which had but one school for the poor and rich residents alike. Under such  circumstances, public schools may well have equalized opportunities. With the  growth of urban and suburban areas, the situation has changed drastically. Our  present school system, far from equalizing opportunity, very likely does the  opposite. It makes it all the harder for the exceptional few and it is they who are  the hope of the future to rise above the poverty of their initial state.   Another argument for nationalizing schooling is ""technical monopoly."" In  small communities and rural areas, the number of children may be too small to  justify more than one school of reasonable size, so that competition cannot be  relied on to protect the interests of parents and children. As in other cases of  technical monopoly, the alternatives are unrestricted private monopoly, state-  controlled private monopoly, and public operation a choice among evils. This  argument, though clearly valid and significant, has been greatly weakened in  recent decades by improvements in transportation and increasing concentration  of the population in urban communities.   The arrangement that perhaps comes closest to being justified by these  considerations at least for primary and secondary education is a combination of  public and private schools. Parents who choose to send their children to private  schools would be paid a sum equal to the estimated cost of educating a child in a  public school, provided that at least this sum was spent on education in an  approved school. This arrangement would meet the valid features of the    80     ""technical monopoly"" argument. It would meet the just complaints of parents  that if they send their children to private non-subsidized schools they are  required to pay twice for education once in the form of general taxes and once  directly. It would permit competition to develop. The development and  improvement of all schools would thus be stimulated. The injection of  competition would do much to promote a healthy variety of schools. It would do  much, also, to introduce flexibility into school systems. Not least of its benefits  would be to make the salaries of school teachers responsive to market forces. It  would thereby give public authorities an independent standard against which to  judge salary scales and promote a more rapid adjustment to changes in  conditions of demand and supply.   It is widely urged that the great need in schooling is more money to build  more facilities and to pay higher salaries to teachers in order to attract better  teachers. This seems a false diagnosis. The amount of money spent on schooling  has been rising at an extraordinarily high rate, far faster than our total income.  Teachers' salaries have been rising far faster than returns in comparable  occupations. The problem is not primarily that we are spending too little money  though we may be but that we are getting so little per dollar spent. Perhaps the  amounts of money spent on magnificent structures and luxurious grounds at  many schools are properly classified as expenditures on schooling. It is hard to  accept them equally as expenditures on education. And this is equally clear with  respect to courses in basket weaving, social dancing, and the numerous other  special subjects that do such credit to the ingenuity of educators. I hasten to add  that there can be no conceivable objection to parents' spending their own money  on such frills if they wish. That is their business. The objection is to using money  raised by taxation imposed on parents and non-parents alike for such purposes.  Wherein are the ""neighborhood effects"" that justify such use of tax money?   A major reason for this kind of use of public money is the present system  of combining the administration of schools with their financing. The parent who  would prefer to see money used for better teachers and texts rather than  coaches and corridors has no way of expressing this preference except by  persuading a majority to change the mixture for all. This is a special case of the  general principle that a market permits each to satisfy his own taste effective  proportional representation; whereas the political process imposes conformity. In  addition, the parent who would like to spend some extra money on his child's  education is greatly limited. He cannot add something to the amount now being  spent to school his child and transfer his child to a correspondingly more costly  school. If he does transfer his child, he must pay the whole cost and not simply  the additional cost. He can only spend extra money easily on extra-curricular  activities dancing lessons, music lessons, etc. Since the private outlets for  spending more money on schooling are so blocked, the pressure to spend more  on the education of children manifests itself in ever higher public expenditures    81     on items ever more tenuously related to the basic justification for governmental  intervention into schooling.   As this analysis implies, the adoption of the suggested arrangements  might well mean smaller governmental expenditures on schooling, yet higher  total expenditures. It would enable parents to buy what they want more  efficiently and thereby lead them to spend more than they now do directly and  indirectly through taxation. It would prevent parents from being frustrated in  spending more money on schooling by both the present need for conformity in  how the money is spent and by the understandable reluctance on the part of  persons not currently having children in school, and especially those who will not  in the future have them in school, to impose higher taxes on themselves for  purposes often far removed from education as they understand the term . 2   With respect to teachers' salaries, the major problem is not that they are  too low on the average they may well be too high on the average but that they  are too uniform and rigid. Poor teachers are grossly overpaid and good teachers  grossly underpaid. Salary schedules tend to be uniform and determined far more  by seniority, degrees received, and teaching certificates acquired than by merit.  This, too, is largely a result of the present system of governmental  administration of schools and becomes more serious as the unit over which  governmental control is exercised becomes larger. Indeed, this very fact is a  major reason why professional educational organizations so strongly favor  broadening the unit from the local school district to the state, from the state to  the federal government. In any bureaucratic, essentially civil-service  organization, standard salary scales are almost inevitable; it is next to impossible  to simulate competition capable of providing wide differences in salaries  according to merit. The educators, which means the teachers themselves, come  to exercise primary control. The parent or local community comes to exercise  little control. In any area, whether it be carpentry or plumbing or teaching, the  majority of workers favor standard salary scales and oppose merit differentials,  for the obvious reason that the specially talented are always few. This is a  special case of the general tendency for people to seek to collude to fix prices,  whether through unions or industrial monopolies. But collusive agreements will  generally be destroyed by competition unless the government enforces them, or  at least renders them considerable support.   If one were to seek deliberately to devise a system of recruiting and  paying teachers calculated to repel the imaginative and daring and self-confident  and to attract the dull and mediocre and uninspiring, he could hardly do better  than imitate the system of requiring teaching certificates and enforcing standard  salary structures that has developed in the larger city and state-wide systems. It  is perhaps surprising that the level of ability in elementary and secondary school  teaching is as high as it is under these circumstances. The alternative system    82     would resolve these problems and permit competition to be effective in  rewarding merit and attracting ability to teaching.   Why has governmental intervention in schooling in the United States  developed along the lines it has? I do not have the detailed knowledge of  educational history that would be required to answer this question definitively. A  few conjectures may nonetheless be useful to suggest the kinds of  considerations that may alter the appropriate social policy. I am by no means  sure that the arrangements I now propose would in fact have been desirable a  century ago. Before the extensive growth in transportation, the ""technical  monopoly"" argument was much stronger. Equally important, the major problem  in the United States in the nineteenth and early twentieth century was not to  promote diversity but to create the core of common values essential to a stable  society. Great streams of immigrants were flooding the United States from all  over the world, speaking different languages and observing diverse customs. The  ""melting pot"" had to introduce some measure of conformity and loyalty to  common values. The public school had an important function in this task, not  least by imposing English as a common language. Under the alternative voucher  scheme, the minimum standards imposed on schools to qualify for approval  could have included the use of English. But it might well have been more difficult  to insure that this requirement was imposed and satisfied in a private school  system. I do not mean to conclude that the public school system was definitely  preferable to the alternative, but only that a far stronger case could have been  made for it then than now. Our problem today is not to enforce conformity; it is  rather that we are threatened with an excess of conformity. Our problem is to  foster diversity, and the alternative would do this far more effectively than a  nationalized school system.   Another factor that may have been important a century ago was the  combination of the general disrepute of cash grants to individuals (""handouts""),  with the absence of an efficient administrative machinery to handle the  distribution of vouchers and check their use. Such machinery is a phenomenon of  modern times that has come to full flower with the enormous extension of  personal taxation and of social security programs. In its absence, the  administration of schools may have been regarded as the only possible way to  finance education.   As some of the examples cited above (England and France) suggest, some  features of the proposed arrangements are present in existing educational  systems. And there has been strong and, I believe, increasing pressure for  arrangements of this kind in most Western countries. This is perhaps partly  explained by modern developments in governmental administrative machinery  that facilitate such arrangements.    83     Although many administrative problems would arise in changing over from  the present to the proposed system and in its administration, these seem neither  insoluble nor unique. As in the denationalization of other activities, existing  premises and equipment could be sold to private enterprises that wanted to  enter the field. Thus, there would be no waste of capital in the transition. Since  governmental units, at least in some areas, would continue to administer  schools, the transition would be gradual and easy. The local administration of  schooling in the United States and some other countries would similarly facilitate  the transition, since it would encourage experimentation on a small scale.  Difficulties would doubtless arise in determining eligibility for grants from a  particular governmental unit, but this is identical with the existing problem of  determining which unit is obligated to provide schooling facilities for a particular  child. Differences in size of grants would make one area more attractive than  another just as differences in the quality of schooling now have the same effect.  The only additional complication is a possibly greater opportunity for abuse  because of the greater freedom to decide where to educate children. Supposed  difficulty of administration is a standard defense of the status quo against any  proposed change; in this particular case, it is an even weaker defense than usual  because existing arrangements must master not only the major problems raised  by the proposed arrangements but also the additional problems raised by the  administration of schools as a governmental function.   Schooling at College and University Level   The preceding discussion is concerned mostly with primary and secondary  schooling. For higher schooling, the case for nationalization on grounds either of  neighborhood effects or of technical monopoly is even weaker. For the lowest  levels of schooling, there is considerable agreement, approximating unanimity,  on the appropriate content of an educational program for citizens of a democracy  the three R's cover most of the ground. At successively higher levels, there is  less and less agreement. Surely, well below the level of the American college,  there is insufficient agreement to justify imposing the views of a majority, much  less a plurality, on all. The lack of agreement may, indeed, extend so far as to  cast doubts on the appropriateness even of subsidizing schooling at this level; it  surely goes far enough to undermine any case for nationalization on the grounds  of providing a common core of values. There can hardly be any question of  ""technical monopoly"" at this level, in view of the distances that individuals can  and do go to attend institutions of higher learning.   Governmental institutions play a smaller role in the United States in higher  schooling than at primary and secondary levels. Yet they grew greatly in  importance, certainly until the 1920's, and now account for more than half of the  students attending colleges and universities. 3 One of the main reasons for their  growth was their relative cheapness; most state and municipal colleges and    84     universities charge much lower tuition fees than private universities can afford to  charge. Private universities have in consequence had serious financial problems,  and have quite properly complained of ""unfair"" competition. They have wanted  to maintain their independence from government, yet at the same time have felt  driven by financial pressure to seek government aid.   The preceding analysis suggests the lines along which a satisfactory  solution can be sought. Public expenditures on higher schooling can be justified  as a means of training youngsters for citizenship and for community leadership  though I hasten to add that the large fraction of current expenditure that goes  for strictly vocational training cannot be justified in this way, or indeed, as we  shall see, in any other. Restricting the subsidy to schooling obtained at a state-  administered institution cannot be justified on any grounds. Any subsidy should  be granted to individuals to be spent at institutions of their own choosing,  provided only that the schooling is of a kind that it is desired to subsidize. Any  government schools that are retained should charge fees covering educational  costs and so compete on an equal level with non-government-supported  schools . 4 The resulting system would follow in its broad outlines the  arrangements adopted in the United States after World War II for financing the  education of veterans, except that the funds would presumably come from the  states rather than the federal government.   The adoption of such arrangements would make for more effective  competition among various types of schools and for a more efficient utilization of  their resources. It would eliminate the pressure for direct government assistance  to private colleges and universities and thus preserve their full independence and  diversity at the same time as it enabled them to grow r
lative to state  institutions. It might also have the ancillary advantage of causing scrutiny of the  purposes for which subsidies are granted. The subsidization of institutions rather  than of people has led to an indiscriminate subsidization of all activities  appropriate for such institutions, rather than of the activities appropriate for the  state to subsidize. Even cursory examination suggests that while the two classes  of activities overlap, they are far from identical.   The equity argument for the alternative arrangement is particularly clear  at college and university levels because of the existence of a large number and  variety of private schools. The state of Ohio, for example, says to its citizens: ""If  you have a youngster who wants to go to college, we shall automatically grant  him or her a sizable four-year scholarship, provided that he or she can satisfy  rather minimal education requirements, and provided further that he or she is  smart enough to choose to go to the University of Ohio. If your youngster wants  to go, or you want him or her to go, to Oberlin College, or Western Reserve  University, let alone to Yale, Harvard, Northwestern, Beloit, or the University of  Chicago, not a penny for him."" How can such a program be justified? Would it    85     not be far more equitable, and promote a higher standard of scholarship, to  devote such money as the state of Ohio wished to spend on higher education to  scholarships tenable at any college or university and to require the University of  Ohio to compete on equal terms with other colleges and universities? 5   Vocational and Professional Schooling   Vocational and professional schooling has no neighborhood effects of the  kind attributed above to general education. It is a form of investment in human  capital precisely analogous to investment in machinery, buildings, or other forms  of non-human capital. Its function is to raise the economic productivity of the  human being. If it does so, the individual is rewarded in a free enterprise society  by receiving a higher return for his services than he would otherwise be able to  command. 6 This difference in return is the economic incentive to invest capital  whether in the form of a machine or a human being. In both cases, extra returns  must be balanced against the costs of acquiring them. For vocational schooling,  the major costs are the income foregone during the period of training, interest  lost by postponing the beginning of the earning period, and special expenses of  acquiring the training such as tuition fees and expenditures on books and  equipment. For physical capital, the major costs are the expense of constructing  the capital equipment and the interest foregone during construction. In both  cases, an individual presumably regards the investment as desirable if the extra  returns, as he views them, exceed the extra costs, as he views them. 7 In both  cases, if the individual undertakes the investment and if the state neither  subsidizes the investment nor taxes the return, the individual (or his parents,  sponsor, or benefactor) in general bears all the extra costs and receives all the  extra returns: there are no obvious unborne costs or unappropriable returns that  tend to make private incentives diverge systematically from those that are  socially appropriate.   If capital were as readily available for investment in human beings as for  investment in physical assets, whether through the market or through direct  investment by the individuals concerned, or their parents or benefactors, the rate  of return on capital would tend to be roughly equal in the two fields. If it were  higher on non-human capital, parents would have an incentive to buy such  capital for their children instead of investing a corresponding sum in vocational  training, and conversely. In fact, however, there is considerable empirical  evidence that the rate of return on investment in training is very much higher  than the rate of return on investment in physical capital. This difference suggests  the existence of underinvestment in human capital 8   This underinvestment in human capital presumably reflects an  imperfection in the capital market. Investment in human beings cannot be  financed on the same terms or with the same ease as investment in physical    86     capital. It is easy to see why. If a fixed money loan is made to finance  investment in physical capital, the lender can get some security for his loan in  the form of a mortgage or residual claim to the physical asset itself, and he can  count on realizing at least part of his investment in case of default by selling the  physical asset. If he makes a comparable loan to increase the earning power of a  human being, he clearly cannot get any comparable security. In a non-slave  state, the individual embodying the investment cannot be bought and sold. Even  if he could, the security would not be comparable. The productivity of the  physical capital does not in general depend on the co-operativeness of the  original borrower. The productivity of the human capital quite obviously does. A  loan to finance the training of an individual who has no security to offer other  than his future earnings is therefore a much less attractive proposition than a  loan to finance the erection of a building: the security is less, and the cost of  subsequent collection of interest and principal is very much greater.   A further complication is introduced by the inappropriateness of fixed  money loans to finance investment in training. Such an investment necessarily  involves much risk. The average expected return may be high, but there is wide  variation about the average. Death or physical incapacity is one obvious source  of variation but this is probably much less important than differences in ability,  energy, and good fortune. Consequently if fixed money loans were made, and  were secured only by expected future earnings, a considerable fraction would  never be repaid. In order to make such loans attractive to lenders, the nominal  interest rate charged on all loans would have to be sufficiently high to  compensate for the capital losses on the defaulted loans. The high nominal  interest rate would both conflict with usury laws and make the loans unattractive  to borrowers . 9 The device adopted to meet the corresponding problem for other  risky investments is equity investment plus limited liability on the part of the  shareholders. The counterpart for education would be to ""buy"" a share in an  individual's earning prospects; to advance him the funds needed to finance his  training on condition that he agree to pay the lender a specified fraction of his  future earnings. In this way, a lender would get back more than his initial  investment from relatively successful individuals, which would compensate for  the failure to recoup his original investment from the unsuccessful.   There seems no legal obstacle to private contracts of this kind, even  though they are economically equivalent to the purchase of a share in an  individual's earning capacity and thus to partial slavery. One reason why such  contracts have not become common, despite their potential profitability to both  lender and borrower, is presumably the high costs of administering them, given  the freedom of individuals to move from one place to another, the need for  getting accurate income statements, and the long period over which the  contracts would run. These costs would presumably be particularly high for  investment on a small scale with a wide geographical spread of the individuals    87     financed. Such costs may well be the primary reason that this type of investment  has never developed under private auspices.   It seems highly likely, however, that a major role has also been played by  the cumulative effect of the novelty of the idea, the reluctance to think of  investment in human beings as strictly comparable to investment in physical  assets, the resultant likelihood of irrational public condemnation of such  contracts, even if voluntarily entered into, and legal and conventional limitations  on the kind of investments that may be made by the financial intermediaries that  would be best suited to engage in such investments, namely, life insurance  companies. The potential gains, particularly to early entrants, are so great that it  would be worth incurring extremely heavy administrative costs . 10   Whatever the reason, an imperfection of the market has led to  underinvestment in human capital. Government intervention might therefore be  rationalized on grounds both of ""technical monopoly,"" insofar as the obstacle to  the development of such investment has been administrative costs, and of  improving the operation of the market, insofar as it has been simply market  frictions and rigidities.   If government does intervene, how should it do so? One obvious form of  intervention, and the only form that has so far been taken, is outright  government subsidy of vocational or professional schooling financed out of  general revenues. This form seems clearly inappropriate. Investment should be  carried to the point at which the extra return repays the investment and yields  the market rate of interest on it. If the investment is in a human being, the extra  return takes the form of a higher payment for the individual's services than he  could otherwise command. In a private market economy, the individual would  get this return as his personal income. If the investment were subsidized, he  would have borne none of the costs. In consequence, if subsidies were given to  all who wished to get the training, and could meet minimum quality standards,  there would tend to be overinvestment in human beings, since individuals would  have an incentive to get the training so long as it yielded any extra return over  private costs, even if the return were insufficient to repay the capital invested, let  alone yield any interest on it. To avoid such overinvestment, government would  have to restrict the subsidies. Even apart from the difficulty of calculating the  ""correct"" amount of investment, this would involve rationing in some essentially  arbitrary way the limited amount of investment among more claimants than  could be financed. Those fortunate enough to get their training subsidized would  receive all the returns from the investment whereas the costs would be borne by  the taxpayers in general an entirely arbitrary and almost surely perverse  redistribution of income.    88     The desideratum is not to redistribute income but to make capital  available at comparable terms for human and physical investment. Individuals  should bear the costs of investment in themselves and receive the rewards. They  should not be prevented by market imperfections from making the investment  when they are willing to bear the costs. One way to achieve this result is for  government to engage in equity investment in human beings. A governmental  body could offer to finance or help finance the training of any individual who  could meet minimum quality standards. It would make available a limited sum  per year for a specified number of years, provided the funds were spent on  securing training at a recognized institution. The individual in return would agree  to pay to the government in each future year a specified percentage of his  earnings in excess of a specified sum for each $ 1,000 that he received from the  government. This payment could easily be combined with payment of income tax  and so involve a minimum of additional administrative expense. The base sum  should be set equal to estimated average earnings without the specialized  training; the fraction of earnings paid should be calculated so as to make the  whole project self-financing. In this way, the individuals who received the  training would in effect bear the whole cost. The amount invested could then be  determined by individual choice. Provided this was the only way in which  government financed vocational or professional training, and provided the  calculated earnings reflected all relevant returns and costs, the free choice of  individuals would tend to produce the optimum amount of investment.   The second proviso is unfortunately not likely to be fully satisfied because  of the impossibility of including non-pecuniary returns mentioned above. In  practice, therefore, investment under the plan would still be somewhat too small  and would not be distributed in the optimum manner. 11   For several reasons, it would be preferable for private financial institutions  and non-profit institutions such as foundations and universities to develop this  plan. Because of the difficulties involved in estimating the base earnings and the  fraction of earnings in excess of the base to be paid to the government, there is  great danger that the scheme would turn into a political football. Information on  existing earnings in various occupations would provide only a rough  approximation to the values that would render the project self-financing. In  addition, the base earnings and the fraction should vary from individual to  individual in accordance with any differences in expected earning capacity that  can be predicted in advance, just as life insurance premiums vary among groups  that have different life expectancy.   Insofar as administrative expense is the obstacle to the development of  such a plan on a private basis, the appropriate unit of government to make funds  available is the federal government rather than smaller units. Any one state  would have the same costs as an insurance company, say, in keeping track of    89     the people whom it had financed. These would be minimized though not  completely eliminated for the federal government. An individual who migrated to  another country, for example, might still be legally or morally obligated to pay  the agreed-on share of his earnings, yet it might be difficult and expensive to  enforce the obligation. Highly successful people might therefore have an  incentive to migrate. A similar problem arises, of course, under the income tax,  and to a very much greater extent. This and other administrative problems of  conducting the scheme on a federal level, while doubtless troublesome in detail,  do not seem serious. The serious problem is the political one already mentioned:  how to prevent the scheme from becoming a political football and in the process  being converted from a self-financing project to a means of subsidizing  vocational education.   But if the danger is real, so is the opportunity. Existing imperfections in  the capital market tend to restrict the more expensive vocational and  professional training to individuals whose parents or benefactors can finance the  training required. They make such individuals a ""non-competing"" group sheltered  from competition by the unavailability of the necessary capital to many able  individuals. The result is to perpetuate inequalities in wealth and status. The  development of arrangements such as those outlined above would make capital  more widely available and would thereby do much to make equality of  opportunity a reality, to diminish inequalities of income and wealth, and to  promote the full use of our human resources. And it would do so not by  impeding competition, destroying incentive, and dealing with symptoms, as  would result from the outright redistribution of income, but by strengthening  competition, making incentives effective, and eliminating the causes of  inequality.",Capitalism and Freedom  The Role of Government in Education,"The policy advocated here is vouchers which students may use for education at a private school of their choice. The author believes that everyone, in a democracy, needs a basic education for citizenship. Though there is underinvestment in human capital (in terms of spending at technical and professional schools), it would be foolish of the government to provide free technical education. The author suggests several solutions, some private, some public, to stop this underinvestment."
"It is a striking historical fact that the development of capitalism has been  accompanied by a major reduction in the extent to which particular religious,  racial, or social groups have operated under special handicaps in respect of their  economic activities; have, as the saying goes, been discriminated against. The  substitution of contract arrangements for status arrangements was the first step  toward the freeing of the serfs in the Middle Ages. The preservation of Jews  through the Middle Ages was possible because of the existence of a market  sector in which they could operate and maintain themselves despite official  persecution. Puritans and Quakers were able to migrate to the New World  because they could accumulate the funds to do so in the market despite  disabilities imposed on them in other aspects of their life. The Southern states  after the Civil War took many measures to impose legal restrictions on Negroes.  One measure which was never taken on any scale was the establishment of  barriers to the ownership of either real or personal property. The failure to  impose such barriers clearly did not reflect any special concern to avoid  restrictions on Negroes. It reflected rather, a basic belief in private property  which was so strong that it overrode the desire to discriminate against Negroes.  The maintenance of the general rules of private property and of capitalism have  been a major source of opportunity for Negroes and have permitted them to  make greater progress than they otherwise could have made. To take a more  general example, the preserves of discrimination in any society are the areas  that are most monopolistic in character, whereas discrimination against groups of  particular color or religion is least in those areas where there is the greatest  freedom of competition.   As pointed out in chapter i, one of the paradoxes of experience is that, in  spite of this historical evidence, it is precisely the minority groups that have  frequently furnished the most vocal and most numerous advocates of  fundamental alterations in a capitalist society. They have tended to attribute to  capitalism the residual restrictions they experience rather than to recognize that  the free market has been the major factor enabling these restrictions to be as  small as they are.   We have already seen how a free market separates economic efficiency  from irrelevant characteristics. As noted in chapter i, the purchaser of bread does  not know whether it was made from wheat grown by a white man or a Negro, by  a Christian or a Jew. In consequence, the producer of wheat is in a position to  use resources as effectively as he can, regardless of what the attitudes of the  community may be toward the color, the religion, or other characteristics of the    93     people he hires. Furthermore, and perhaps more important, there is an economic  incentive in a free market to separate economic efficiency from other  characteristics of the individual. A businessman or an entrepreneur who  expresses preferences in his business activities that are not related to productive  efficiency is at a disadvantage compared to other individuals who do not. Such  an individual is in effect imposing higher costs on himself than are other  individuals who do not have such preferences. Hence, in a free market they will  tend to drive him out.   This same phenomenon is of much wider scope. It is often taken for  granted that the person who discriminates against others because of their race,  religion, color, or whatever, incurs no costs by doing so but simply imposes costs  on others. This view is on a par with the very similar fallacy that a country does  not hurt itself by imposing tariffs on the products of other countries. 1 Both are  equally wrong. The man who objects to buying from or working alongside a  Negro, for example, thereby limits his range of choice. He will generally have to  pay a higher price for what he buys or receive a lower return for his work. Or,  put the other way, those of us who regard color of skin or religion as irrelevant  can buy some things more cheaply as a result.   As these comments perhaps suggest, there are real problems in defining  and interpreting discrimination. The man who exercises discrimination pays a  price for doing so. He is, as it were, ""buying"" what he regards as a ""product."" It  is hard to see that discrimination can have any meaning other than a ""taste"" of  others that one does not share. We do not regard it as ""discrimination"" or at  least not in the same invidious sense if an individual is willing to pay a higher  price to listen to one singer than to another, although we do if he is willing to  pay a higher price to have services rendered to him by a person of one color  than by a person of another. The difference between the two cases is that in the  one case we share the taste, and in the other case we do not. Is there any  difference in principle between the taste that leads a householder to prefer an  attractive servant to an ugly one and the taste that leads another to prefer a  Negro to a white or a white to a Negro, except that we sympathize and agree  with the one taste and may not with the other? I do not mean to say that all  tastes are equally good.   On the contrary, I believe strongly that the color of a man's skin or the  religion of his parents is, by itself, no reason to treat him differently; that a man  should be judged by what he is and what he does and not by these external  characteristics. I deplore what seem to me the prejudice and narrowness of  outlook of those whose tastes differ from mine in this respect and I think the less  of them for it. But in a society based on free discussion, the appropriate recourse  is for me to seek to persuade them that their tastes are bad and that they should    94     change their views and their behavior, not to use coercive power to enforce my  tastes and my attitudes on others.   Fair Employment Practices Legislation   Fair employment practice commissions that have the task of preventing  ""discrimination"" in employment by reason of race, color, or religion have been  established in a number of states. Such legislation clearly involves interference  with the freedom of individuals to enter into voluntary contracts with one  another. It subjects any such contract to approval or disapproval by the state.  Thus it is directly an interference with freedom of the kind that we would object  to in most other contexts. Moreover, as is true with most other interferences  with freedom, the individuals subjected to the law may well not be those whose  actions even the proponents of the law wish to control.   For example, consider a situation in which there are grocery stores serving  a neighborhood inhabited by people who have a strong aversion to being waited  on by Negro clerks. Suppose one of the grocery stores has a vacancy for a clerk  and the first applicant qualified in other respects happens to be a Negro. Let us  suppose that as a result of the law the store is required to hire him. The effect of  this action will be to reduce the business done by this store and to impose losses  on the owner. If the preference of the community is strong enough, it may even  cause the store to close. When the owner of the store hires white clerks in  preference to Negroes in the absence of the law, he may not be expressing any  preference or prejudice or taste of his own. Fie may simply be transmitting the  tastes of the community. Fie is, as it were, producing the services for the  consumers that the consumers are willing to pay for. Nonetheless, he is harmed,  and indeed may be the only one harmed appreciably, by a law which prohibits  him from engaging in this activity, that is, prohibits him from pandering to the  tastes of the community for having a white rather than a Negro clerk. The  consumers, whose preferences the law is intended to curb, will be affected  substantially only to the extent that the number of stores is limited and hence  they must pay higher prices because one store has gone out of business. This  analysis can be generalized. In a very large fraction of cases, employers are  transmitting the preference of either their customers or their other employees  when they adopt employment policies that treat factors irrelevant to technical  physical productivity as relevant to employment. Indeed, employers typically  have an incentive, as noted earlier, to try to find ways of getting around the  preferences of their consumers or of their employees if such preferences impose  higher costs upon them.   The proponents of FEPC argue that interference with the freedom of  individuals to enter into contracts with one another with respect to employment  is justified because the individual who refuses to hire a Negro instead of a white,    95     when both are equally qualified in terms of physical productive capacity, is  harming others, namely, the particular color or religious group whose  employment opportunity is limited in the process. This argument involves a  serious confusion between two very different kinds of harm. One kind is the  positive harm that one individual does another by physical force, or by forcing  him to enter into a contract without his consent. An obvious example is the man  who hits another over the head with a blackjack. A less obvious example is  stream pollution discussed in chapter ii. The second kind is the negative harm  that occurs when two individuals are unable to find mutually acceptable  contracts, as when I am unwilling to buy something that someone wants to sell  me and therefore make him worse off than he would be if I bought the item. If  the community at large has a preference for blues singers rather than for opera  singers, they are certainly increasing the economic well-being of the first relative  to the second. If a potential blues singer can find employment and a potential  opera singer cannot, this simply means that the blues singer is rendering  services which the community regards as worth paying for whereas the potential  opera singer is not. The potential opera singer is ""harmed"" by the community's  taste. He would be better off and the blues singer ""harmed"" if the tastes were  the reverse. Clearly, this kind of harm does not involve any involuntary exchange  or an imposition of costs or granting of benefits to third parties. There is a strong  case for using government to prevent one person from imposing positive harm,  which is to say, to prevent coercion. There is no case whatsoever for using  government to avoid the negative kind of ""harm."" On the contrary, such  government intervention reduces freedom and limits voluntary co-operation.   FEPC legislation involves the acceptance of a principle that proponents  would find abhorrent in almost every other application. If it is appropriate for the  state to say that individuals may not discriminate in employment because of  color or race or religion, then it is equally appropriate for the state, provided a  majority can be found to vote that way, to say that individuals must discriminate  in employment on the basis of color, race or religion. The Hitler Nuremberg laws  and the laws in the Southern states imposing special disabilities upon Negroes  are both examples of laws similar in principle to FEPC. Opponents of such laws  who are in favor of FEPC cannot argue that there is anything wrong with them in  principle, that they involve a kind of state action that ought not to be permitted.  They can only argue that the particular criteria used are irrelevant. They can only  seek to persuade other men that they should use other criteria instead of these.   If one takes a broad sweep of history and looks at the kind of things that  the majority will be persuaded of if each individual case is to be decided on its  merits rather than as part of a general principle, there can be little doubt that the  effect of a widespread acceptance of the appropriateness of government action  in this area would be extremely undesirable, even from the point of view of those  who at the moment favor FEPC. If, at the moment, the proponents of FEPC are    96     in a position to make their views effective, it is only because of a constitutional  and federal situation in which a regional majority in one part of the country may  be in a position to impose its views on a majority in another part of the country.   As a general rule, any minority that counts on specific majority action to  defend its interests is short-sighted in the extreme. Acceptance of a general self-  denying ordinance applying to a class of cases may inhibit specific majorities  from exploiting specific minorities. In the absence of such a self-denying  ordinance, majorities can surely be counted on to use their power to give effect  to their preferences, or if you will, prejudices, not to protect minorities from the  prejudices of majorities.   To put the matter in another and perhaps more striking way, consider an  individual who believes that the present pattern of tastes is undesirable and who  believes that Negroes have less opportunity than he would like to see them have.  Suppose he puts his beliefs into practice by always choosing the Negro applicant  for a job whenever there are a number of applicants more or less equally  qualified in other respects. Under present circumstances should he be prevented  from doing so? Clearly the logic of the FEPC is that he should be.   The counterpart to fair employment in the area where these principles  have perhaps been worked out more than any other, namely, the area of  speech, is ""fair speech"" rather than free speech. In this respect the position of  the American Civil Liberties Union seems utterly contradictory. It favors both free  speech and fair employment laws. One way to state the justification for free  speech is that we do not believe that it is desirable that momentary majorities  decide what at any moment shall be regarded as appropriate speech. We want a  free market in ideas, so that ideas get a chance to win majority or near-  unanimous acceptance, even if initially held only by a few. Precisely the same  considerations apply to employment or more generally to the market for goods  and services. Is it any more desirable that momentary majorities decide what  characteristics are relevant to employment than what speech is appropriate?  Indeed, can a free market in ideas long be maintained if a free market in goods  and services is destroyed? The ACLU will fight to the death to protect the right of  a racist to preach on a street corner the doctrine of racial segregation. But it will  favor putting him in jail if he acts on his principles by refusing to hire a Negro for  a particular job.   As already stressed, the appropriate recourse of those of us who believe  that a particular criterion such as color is irrelevant is to persuade our fellows to  be of like mind, not to use the coercive power of the state to force them to act in  accordance with our principles. Of all groups, the ACLU should be the first both  to recognize and proclaim that this is so.    97     Right-to-Work Laws    Some states have passed so-called ""right-to-work"" laws. These are laws  which make it illegal to require membership in a union as a condition of  employment.   The principles involved in right-to-work laws are identical with those  involved in FEPC. Both interfere with the freedom of the employment contract, in  the one case by specifying that a particular color or religion cannot be made a  condition of employment; in the other, that membership in a union cannot be.  Despite the identity of principle, there is almost 100 per cent divergence of views  with respect to the two laws. Almost all who favor FEPC oppose right to work;  almost all who favor right to work oppose FEPC. As a liberal, I am opposed to  both, as I am equally to laws outlawing the so-called ""yellow-dog"" contract (a  contract making non-membership in a union a condition of employment).   Given competition among employers and employees, there seems no  reason why employers should not be free to offer any terms they want to their  employees. In some cases employers find that employees prefer to have part of  their rem
neration take the form of amenities such as baseball fields or play  facilities or better rest facilities rather than cash. Employers then find that it is  more profitable to offer these facilities as part of their employment contract  rather than to offer higher cash wages. Similarly, employers may offer pension  plans, or require participation in pension plans, and the like. None of this  involves any interference with the freedom of individuals to find employment. It  simply reflects an attempt by employers to make the characteristics of the job  suitable and attractive to employees. So long as there are many employers, all  employees who have particular kinds of wants will be able to satisfy them by  finding employment with corresponding employers. Under competitive conditions  the same thing would be true with respect to the closed shop. If in fact some  employees would prefer to work in firms that have a closed shop and others in  firms that have an open shop, there would develop different forms of  employment contracts, some having the one provision, others the other  provision.   As a practical matter, of course, there are some important differences  between FEPC and right to work. The differences are the presence of monopoly  in the form of union organizations on the employee side and the presence of  federal legislation in respect of labor unions. It is doubtful that in a competitive  labor market, it would in fact ever be profitable for employers to offer a closed  shop as a condition of employment. Whereas unions may frequently be found  without any strong monopoly power on the side of labor, a closed shop almost  never is. It is almost always a symbol of monopoly power.    98     The coincidence of a closed shop and labor monopoly is not an argument  for a right-to-work law. It is an argument for action to eliminate monopoly power  regardless of the particular forms and manifestations which it takes. It is an  argument for more effective and widespread antitrust action in the labor field.   Another special feature that is important in practice is the conflict between  federal and state law and the existence at the moment of a federal law which  applies to all the states and which leaves a loophole for the individual state only  through the passage of a right-to-work law. The optimum solution would be to  have the federal law revised. The difficulty is that no individual state is in a  position to bring this about and yet people within an individual state might wish  to have a change in the legislation governing union organization within their  state. The right-to-work law may be the only effective way in which this can be  done and therefore the lesser of evils. Partly,   I suppose, because I am inclined to believe that a right-to-work law will  not in and of itself have any great effect on the monopoly power of the unions, I  do not accept this justification for it. The practical arguments seem to me much  too weak to outweigh the objection of principle.   Segregation in Schooling   Segregation in schooling raises a particular problem not covered by the  previous comments for one reason only. The reason is that schooling is, under  present circumstances, primarily operated and administered by government. This  means that government must make an explicit decision. It must either enforce  segregation or enforce integration. Both seem to me bad solutions. Those of us  who believe that color of skin is an irrelevant characteristic and that it is  desirable for all to recognize this, yet who also believe in individual freedom, are  therefore faced with a dilemma. If one must choose between the evils of  enforced segregation or enforced integration, I myself would find it impossible  not to choose integration.   The preceding chapter, written initially without any regard at all to the  problem of segregation or integration, gives the appropriate solution that permits  the avoidance of both evils a nice illustration of how arrangements designed to  enhance freedom in general cope with problems of freedom in particular. The  appropriate solution is to eliminate government operation of the schools and  permit parents to choose the kind of school they want their children to attend. In  addition, of course, we should all of us, insofar as we possibly can, try by  behavior and speech to foster the growth of attitudes and opinions that would  lead mixed schools to become the rule and segregated schools the rare  exception.    99     If a proposal like that of the preceding chapter were adopted, it would  permit a variety of schools to develop, some all white, some all Negro, some  mixed. It would permit the transition from one collection of schools to another  hopefully to mixed schools to be gradual as community attitudes changed. It  would avoid the harsh political conflict that has been doing so much to raise  social tensions and disrupt the community. It would in this special area, as the  market does in general, permit co-operation without conformity . 2   The state of Virginia has adopted a plan having many features in common  with that outlined in the preceding chapter. Though adopted for the purpose of  avoiding compulsory integration, I predict that the ultimate effects of the law will  be very different after all, the difference between result and intention is one of  the primary justifications of a free society; it is desirable to let men follow the  bent of their own interests because there is no way of predicting where they will  come out. Indeed, even in the early stages there have been surprises. I have  been told that one of the first requests for a voucher to finance a change of  school was by a parent transferring a child from a segregated to an integrated  school. The transfer was requested not for this purpose but simply because the  integrated school happened to be the better school educationally. Looking  further ahead, if the voucher system is not abolished, Virginia will provide an  experiment to test the conclusions of the preceding chapter. If those conclusions  are right, we should see a flowering of the schools available in Virginia, with an  increase in their diversity, a substantial if not spectacular rise in the quality of the  leading schools, and a later rise in the quality of the rest under the impetus of  the leaders.   On the other side of the picture, we should not be so naive as to suppose  that deep-seated values and beliefs can be uprooted in short measure by law. I  live in Chicago. Chicago has no law compelling segregation. Its laws require  integration. Yet in fact the public schools of Chicago are probably as thoroughly  segregated as the schools of most Southern cities. There is almost no doubt at  all that if the Virginia system were introduced in Chicago, the result would be an  appreciable decrease in segregation, and a great widening in the opportunities  available to the ablest and most ambitious Negro youth.",Capitalism and Freedom  Capitalism and Discrimination,"In a capitalist society, Friedman argues, it costs money to discriminate, and it is very difficult, given the impersonal nature of market transactions. However, the government should not make fair employment practices laws (eventually embodied in the Civil Rights Act of 1964), as these inhibit the freedom to employ someone based on whatever qualifications the employer wishes to use. The same principle was used by the Nazis in the Nuremberg Laws. For the same reason, right-to-work laws should be abolished."
"Competition has two very different meanings. In ordinary discourse,  competition means personal rivalry, with one individual seeking to outdo his  known competitor. In the economic world, competition means almost the  opposite. There is no personal rivalry in the competitive market place. There is  no personal higgling. The wheat farmer in a free market does not feel himself in  personal rivalry with, or threatened by, his neighbor, who is, in fact, his  competitor. The essence of a competitive market is its impersonal character. No  one participant can determine the terms on which other participants shall have  access to goods or jobs. All take prices as given by the market and no individual  can by himself have more than a negligible influence on price though all  participants together determine price by the combined effect of their separate  actions.   Monopoly exists when a specific individual or enterprise has sufficient  control over a particular product or service to determine significantly the terms  on which other individuals shall have access to it. In some ways, monopoly  comes closer to the ordinary concept of competition since it does involve  personal rivalry.   Monopoly raises two classes of problems for a free society. First, the  existence of monopoly means a limitation on voluntary exchange through a  reduction in the alternatives available to individuals. Second, the existence of  monopoly raises the issue of the ""social responsibility,"" as it has come to be  called, of the monopolist. The participant in a competitive market has no  appreciable power to alter terms of exchange; he is hardly visible as a separate  entity; hence it is hard to argue that he has any ""social responsibility"" except  that which is shared by all citizens to obey the law of the land and to live  according to his lights. The monopolist is visible and has power. It is easy to  argue that he should discharge his power not solely to further his own interests  but to further socially desirable ends. Yet the widespread application of such a  doctrine would destroy a free society.   Of course, competition is an ideal type, like a Euclidean line or point. No  one has ever seen a Euclidean line which has zero width and depth yet we all  find it useful to regard many a Euclidean volume such as a surveyor's string as a  Euclidean line. Similarly, there is no such thing as ""pure"" competition. Every  producer has some effect, however tiny, on the price of the product he  produces. The important issue for understanding and for policy is whether this    102     effect is significant or can properly be neglected, as the surveyor can neglect the  thickness of what he calls a ""line."" The answer must, of course, depend on the  problem. But as I have studied economic activities in the United States, I have  become increasingly impressed with how wide is the range of problems and  industries for which it is appropriate to treat the economy as if it were  competitive.   The issues raised by monopoly are technical and cover a field in which I  have no special competence. In consequence, this chapter is limited to a fairly  cursory survey of some of the broader issues: the extent of monopoly, sources of  monopoly, appropriate government policy, and the social responsibility of  business and labor.   The Extent of Monopoly   There are three important areas of monopoly requiring separate  consideration: monopoly in industry, monopoly in labor, and governmentally  produced monopoly.   1. Monopoly in Industry The most important fact about enterprise  monopoly is its relative unimportance from the point of view of the economy as a  whole. There are some four million separate operating enterprises in the United  States; some four hundred thousand new ones are born each year; a somewhat  smaller number die each year. Nearly one fifth of the working population is self-  employed. In almost any industry that one can mention, there are giants and  pygmies side by side.   Beyond these general impressions, it is difficult to cite a satisfactory  objective measure of the extent of monopoly and of competition. The main  reason is one already noted: these concepts as used in economic theory are ideal  constructs designed to analyze particular problems rather than to describe  existing situations. As a result, there can be no clear-cut determination of  whether a particular enterprise or industry is to be regarded as monopolistic or  as competitive. The difficulty of assigning precise meanings to such terms leads  to much misunderstanding. The same word is used to refer to different things,  depending on the background of experience in terms of which the state of  competition is judged. Perhaps the most striking example is the extent to which  an American student will describe as monopolistic, arrangements that a  European would regard as highly competitive. As a result, Europeans interpreting  American literature and discussion in terms of the meaning attached to the terms  competition and monopoly in Europe tend to believe that there is a much greater  degree of monopoly in the United States than in fact exists.    103     A number of studies, particularly by G. Warren Nutter and George J.  Stigler, have tried to classify industries as monopolistic, workably competitive,  and governmentally operated or supervised, and to trace changes over time in  these categories. 1 They conclude that, as of 1939, roughly one quarter of the  economy could be regarded as governmentally operated or supervised. Of the  three-quarters remaining, at most one-quarter and perhaps as little as 15  percent can be regarded as monopolistic, at least three-quarters and perhaps as  much as 85 percent, as competitive. The governmentally operated or supervised  sector has of course grown greatly over the past half-century or so. Within the  private sector, on the other hand, there appears not to have been any tendency  for the scope of monopoly to have increased and it may well have decreased.   There is, I suspect, a widespread impression that monopoly is both far  more important than these estimates suggest and has been growing steadily  over time. One reason for this mistaken impression is the tendency to confuse  absolute and relative size. As the economy has grown, enterprises have become  larger in absolute size. This has been taken to mean also that they account for a  larger fraction of the market, whereas the market may have grown even faster.  A second reason is that monopoly is more newsworthy and leads to more  attention than competition. If individuals were asked to list the major industries  in the United States, almost all would include automobile production, few would  include wholesale trade. Yet wholesale trade is twice as important as automobile  production. Wholesale trade is highly competitive, hence draws little attention to  itself. Few people could name any leading enterprises in wholesale trade, though  there are some that are very large in absolute size. Automobile production, while  in certain respects highly competitive, has many fewer firms and is certainly  closer to monopoly. Everyone can name the leading firms producing  automobiles. To cite one other striking example: domestic service is a vastly  more important industry than the telegraph and telephone industry. A third  reason is the general bias and tendency to overemphasize the importance of the  big versus the small, of which the preceding point is only a particular  manifestation. Finally, the main characteristic of our society is taken to be its  industrial character. This leads to overemphasis of the manufacturing sector of  the economy, which accounts for only about one-quarter of output or  employment. And monopoly is far more prevalent in manufacturing than in other  sectors of the economy.   The over-estimation of the importance of monopoly is accompanied, for  much the same reasons, by an over-estimation of the importance of those  technological changes that promote monopoly by comparison with those that  extend competition. For example, the spread of mass production has been  greatly stressed. The developments in transportation and communication that  have promoted competition by reducing the importance of local regional markets  and widening the scope within which competition could take place have been    104     given much less attention. The growing concentration of the automobile industry  is a commonplace; growth of the trucking industry which reduces dependence on  large railroads passes with little notice; so does the declining concentration in the  steel industry.   2. Monopoly in Labor There is a similar tendency to overestimate the  importance of monopoly on the side of labor. Labor unions include roughly a  quarter of the working population and this greatly overestimates the importance  of unions on the structure of wages. Many unions are utterly ineffective. Even  the strong and powerful unions have only a limited effect on the wage structure.  It is even clearer for labor than for industry why there is a strong tendency to  overestimate the importance of monopoly. Given a labor union, any wage  increase will come through the union, even though it may not be a consequence  of the union organization. The wages of domestic servants have risen very  greatly in recent years. Had there been a union of domestic servants, the  increase would have come through the union and would have been attributed to  it.    This is not to say that unions are unimportant. Like enterprise monopoly,  they play a significant and meaningful role making many wage rates different  from what the market alone would establish. It would be as much a mistake to  underestimate as to overestimate their importance. I once made a rough  estimate that because of unions something like 10 to 15 per cent of the working  population has had its wage rates raised by something like 10 to 15 per cent.  This means that something like 85 or 90 per cent of the working population has  had its wage rates reduced by some 4 per cent. 2 Since I made these estimates,  much more detailed studies have been done by others. My impression is that  they yield results of much the same order of magnitude.   If unions raise wage rates in a particular occupation or industry, they  necessarily make the amount of employment available in that occupation or  industry less than it otherwise would be just as any higher price cuts down the  amount purchased. The effect is an increased number of persons seeking other  jobs, which forces down wages in other occupations. Since unions have generally  been strongest among groups that would have been high-paid anyway, their  effect has been to make high-paid workers higher paid at the expense of lower-  paid workers. Unions have therefore not only harmed the public at large and  workers as a whole by distorting the use of labor; they have also made the  incomes of the working class more unequal by reducing the opportunities  available to the most disadvantaged workers.   In one respect, there is an important difference between labor and  enterprise monopoly. While there seems not to have been any upward trend in  the importance of enterprise monopoly over the past half-century, there certainly    105     has been in the importance of labor monopoly. Labor unions grew notably in  importance during World War I, declined during the 'twenties and early 'thirties,  then took an enormous leap forward during the New Deal period. They  consolidated their gains during and after World War II. More recently, they have  been just holding their own or even declining. The decline does not reflect a  decline within particular industries or occupations but rather a declining  importance of those industries or occupations in which unions are strong relative  to those in which unions are weak.   The distinction I have been drawing between labor monopoly and  enterprise monopoly is in one respect too sharp. To some extent, labor unions  have served as a means of enforcing monopoly in the sale of a product. The  clearest example is in coal. The Guffey Coal Act was an attempt to provide legal  support for a price-fixing cartel of coal-mine operators. When, in the mid-thirties,  this Act was declared unconstitutional, John L. Lewis and the United Mine  Workers stepped into the breach. By calling strikes or work stoppages whenever  the amount of coal above the ground got so large as to threaten to force down  prices, Lewis controlled output and thereby prices with the unspoken co-  operation of the industry. The gains from this cartel management were divided  between the coal mine operators and the miners. The gain to the miners was in  the form of higher wage rates, which of course meant fewer miners employed.  Hence only those miners who retained employment shared the cartel gains and  even they took a large part of the gain in the form of greater leisure. The  possibility of the unions playing this role derives from their exemption from the  Sherman Antitrust Act. Many other unions have taken advantage of this  exemption and are better interpreted as enterprises selling the services of  cartellizing an industry than as labor organizations. The Teamster's Union is  perhaps the most notable.   3. Government and Government-Supported Monopoly In the United  States, direct government monopoly in the production of goods for sale is not  very extensive. The post office, electric power production, as by TVA and other  publicly owned power stations; the provision of highway services, sold indirectly  through the gasoline tax or directly by tolls, and municipal water and similar  plants are the main examples. In addition, with so large a defense, space, and  research budget as we now have, the federal government has become  essentially the only purchaser of the products of many enterprises and whole  industries. This raises very serious problems for the preservation of a free  society, but not of a kind that are best considered under the heading of  ""monopoly.""   The use of government to establish, support and enforce cartel and  monopoly arrangements among private producers has grown much more rapidly  than direct government monopoly and is currently far more important. The    106     Interstate Commerce Commission is an early example, and it has extended its  scope from railroads to trucking and other means of transport. The agricultural  program is undoubtedly the most notorious. It is essentially a governmentally  enforced cartel. Other examples are the Federal Communications Commission,  with its control over radio and television; the Federal Power Commission, with its  control over oil and gas moving in interstate trade; the Civil Aeronautics Board,  with its control over airlines; and the enforcement by the Federal Reserve Board  of maximum interest rates that banks may pay on time deposits, and the legal  prohibition of the payment of interest on demand deposits.   These examples are on a federal level. In addition, there has been a great  proliferation of similar developments on a state and local level. The Texas  Railroad Commission, which so far as I know, has nothing to do with railroads,  enforces output restrictions on oil wells, by limiting the number of days when  wells may produce. It does so in the name of conservation but in fact for the  purpose of controlling prices. More recently, it has been strongly assisted by  federal import quotas on oil. Keeping oil wells idle most of the time to keep up  prices seems to me featherbedding of precisely the same kind as paying coal  firemen on diesel locomotives for being idle. Yet some representatives of  business who are loudest in their condemnation of labor featherbedding as a  violation of free enterprise notably the oil industry itself are deafeningly silent  about featherbedding in oil.   Licensure provisions, discussed in the next chapter, are another example  of governmentally created and supported monopoly on a state level. Restrictions  on the number of taxicabs that can be operated exemplify similar restriction on a  local level. In New York, a medallion signifying the right to operate an  independent cab now sells for something like $ 20,000 to $ 25,000; in  Philadelphia, for $ 15,000. Another example
on a local level is the enactment of  building codes, ostensibly designed for public safety, but in fact generally under  the control of local building trade unions or associations of private contractors.  Such restrictions are numerous and apply to a considerable variety of activities  on both city and state levels. All constitute arbitrary limitations on the ability of  individuals to enter into voluntary exchanges with one another. They  simultaneously restrict freedom and promote the waste of resources.   A kind of governmentally created monopoly very different in principle from  those so far considered is the grant of patents to inventors and copyrights to  authors. These are different, because they can equally be regarded as defining  property rights. In a literal sense, if I have a property right to a particular piece  of land, I can be said to have a monopoly with respect to that piece of land  defined and enforced by the government. With respect to inventions and  publications, the problem is whether it is desirable to establish an analogous    107     property right. This problem is part of the general need to use government to  establish what shall and what shall not be regarded as property.   In both patents and copyrights, there is clearly a strong prima facie case  for establishing property rights. Unless this is done, the inventor will find it  difficult or impossible to collect a payment for the contribution his invention  makes to output. He will, that is, confer benefits on others for which he cannot  be compensated. Hence he will have no incentive to devote the time and effort  required to produce the invention. Similar considerations apply to the writer.   At the same time, there are costs involved. For one thing, there are many  ""inventions"" that are not patentable. The ""inventor"" of the supermarket, for  example, conferred great benefits on his fellowmen for which he could not  charge them. Insofar as the same kind of ability is required for the one kind of  invention as for the other, the existence of patents tends to divert activity to  patentable inventions. For another, trivial patents, or patents that would be of  dubious legality if contested in court, are often used as a device for maintaining  private collusive arrangements that would otherwise be more difficult or  impossible to maintain.   These are very superficial comments on a difficult and important problem.  Their aim is not to suggest any specific answer but only to show why patents  and copyrights are in a different class from the other governmentally supported  monopolies and to illustrate the problem of social policy that they raise. One  thing is clear. The specific conditions attached to patents and copyrights for  example, the grant of patent protection for seventeen years rather than some  other period are not a matter of principle. They are matters of expediency to be  determined by practical considerations. I am myself inclined to believe that a  much shorter period of patent protection would be preferable. But this is a casual  judgment on a subject on which there has been much detailed study and on  which much more is needed. Hence, it is deserving of little confidence.   The Sources of Monopoly   There are three major sources of monopoly: ""technical"" considerations,  direct and indirect governmental assistance, and private collusion.   1. Technical Considerations as pointed out in chapter ii, monopoly arises  to some extent because technical considerations make it more efficient or  economical to have a single enterprise rather than many. The most obvious  example is a telephone system, water system, and the like in an individual  community. There is unfortunately no good solution for technical monopoly.  There is only a choice among three evils: private unregulated monopoly, private  monopoly regulated by the state, and government operation.    108     It seems impossible to state as a general proposition that one of these  evils is uniformly preferable to another. As stated in chapter ii, the great  disadvantage of either governmental regulation or governmental operation of  monopoly is that it is exceedingly difficult to reverse. In consequence, I am  inclined to urge that the least of the evils is private unregulated monopoly  wherever this is tolerable. Dynamic changes are highly likely to undermine it and  there is at least some chance that these will be allowed to have their effect. And  even in the short run, there is generally a wider range of substitutes than there  seems to be at first blush, so private enterprises are fairly narrowly limited in the  extent to which it is profitable to keep prices above cost. Moreover, as we have  seen, the regulatory agencies often tend themselves to fall under the control of  the producers and so prices may not be any lower with regulation than without  regulation.   Fortunately, the areas in which technical considerations make monopoly a  likely or a probable outcome are fairly limited. They would offer no serious threat  to the preservation of a free economy if it were not for the tendency of  regulation, introduced on this ground, to spread to situations in which it is not so  justified.   2. Direct and Indirect Government Assistance Probably the most important  source of monopoly power has been government assistance, direct and indirect.  Numerous examples of reasonably direct government assistance have been cited  above. The indirect assistance to monopoly consists of measures taken for other  purposes which have as a largely unintended effect the imposition of limitations  on potential competitors of existing firms. Perhaps the three clearest examples  are tariffs, tax legislation, and law enforcement and legislation with respect to  labor disputes.   Tariffs have of course been imposed largely to ""protect"" domestic  industries, which means to impose handicaps on potential competitors. They  always interfere with the freedom of individuals to engage in voluntary  exchange. After all, the liberal takes the individual, not the nation or citizen of a  particular nation, as his unit. Hence he regards it just as much a violation of  freedom if citizens of the United States and Switzerland are prevented from  consummating an exchange that would be mutually advantageous as if two  citizens of the United States are prevented from doing so. Tariffs need not  produce monopoly. If the market for the protected industry is sufficiently large  and technical conditions permit many firms, there can be effective competition  domestically in the protected industry, as in the United States in textiles. Clearly,  however, tariffs do foster monopoly. It is far easier for a few firms than for many  to collude to fix prices, and it is generally easier for enterprises in the same  country to collude than for enterprises in different countries. Britain was    109     protected by free trade from widespread monopoly during the nineteenth and  early twentieth centuries, despite the relatively small size of her domestic market  and the large scale of many firms. Monopoly has become a much more serious  problem in Britain since free trade was abandoned, first after World War I and  then more extensively in the early 1930's.   The effects of tax legislation have been even more indirect yet not less  important. A major element has been the linkage of the corporate and individual  income tax combined with the special treatment of capital gains under the  individual income tax. Let us suppose a corporation earns an income of $ 1  million over and above corporate taxes. If it pays the whole million dollars to its  stockholders as dividends, they must include it as part of their taxable income.  Suppose they would, on the average, have to pay 50 per cent of this additional  income as income tax. They would then have available only $ 500, 000 to spend  on consumption or to save and invest. If instead the corporation pays no cash  dividends to its stockholders, it has the whole million dollars to invest internally.  Such reinvestment will tend to raise the capital value of its stock, stockholders  who would have saved the funds if distributed can simply hold the stock and  postpone all taxes until they sell the stock. They, as well as others who sell at an  earlier date to realize income for consumption, will pay tax at capital gains rates,  which are lower than rates on regular income.   This tax structure encourages retention of corporate earnings. Even if the  return that can be earned internally is appreciably less than the return that the  stockholder himself could earn by investing the funds externally, it may pay to  invest internally because of the tax saving. This leads to a waste of capital, to its  use for less productive rather than more productive purposes. It has been a  major reason for the post-World-War-l I tendency toward horizontal  diversification as firms have sought outlets for their earnings. It is also a great  source of strength for established corporations relative to new enterprises. The  established corporations can be less productive than new enterprises, yet their  stockholders have an incentive to invest in them rather than to have the income  paid out so that they can invest it in new enterprises through the capital market.   A major source of labor monopoly has been government assistance.  Licensure provisions, building codes, and the like, discussed above have been  one source. Legislation granting special immunities to labor unions, such as  exemption from the anti-trust laws, restrictions on union responsibility, the right  to appear before special tribunals, and so on, are a second source. Perhaps of  equal or greater importance than either is a general climate of opinion and law  enforcement applying different standards to actions taken in the course of a  labor dispute than to the same actions under other circumstances. If men turn  cars over, or destroy property, out of sheer wickedness or in the course of  exacting private vengeance, not a hand will be lifted to protect them from the    110     legal consequences. If they commit the same acts in the course of labor dispute,  they may well get off scot free. Union actions involving actual or potential  physical violence or coercion could hardly take place if it were not for the  unspoken acquiescence of the authorities.   3. Private Collusion The final source of monopoly is private collusion. As  Adam Smith says, ""People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for  merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the  public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."" 3 Such collusion or private cartel  arrangements are therefore constantly arising. However, they are generally  unstable and of brief duration unless they can call government to their  assistance. The establishment of the cartel, by raising prices, makes it more  profitable for outsiders to enter the industry. Moreover, since the higher price  can be established only by the participants' restricting their output below the  level that they would like to produce at the fixed price, there is an incentive for  each one separately to undercut the price in order to expand output. Each one,  of course, hopes that the others will abide by the agreement. It takes only one  or at most a few ""chiselers"" who are indeed public benefactors to break the  cartel. In the absence of government assistance in enforcing the cartel, they are  almost sure to succeed fairly promptly.   The major role of our antitrust laws has been to inhibit such private  collusion. Their main contribution in this respect has been less through actual  prosecutions than by their indirect effects. They have ruled out the obvious  collusive devices such as the public get-together for this specific purposeand  have therefore made collusion more expensive. More important, they have  reaffirmed common law doctrine that combinations in restraint of trade are  unenforceable in the courts. In various European countries, the courts will  enforce an agreement entered into by a group of enterprises to sell only through  a joint selling agency, committing the enterprises to pay specified penalties if  they violate the agreement. In the United States, such an agreement would not  be enforceable in the courts. This difference is one of the major reasons why  cartels have been more stable and widespread in European countries than in the  United States.   Appropriate Government Policy   The first and most urgent necessity in the area of government policy is  the elimination of those measures which directly support monopoly, whether  enterprise monopoly or labor monopoly, and an even-handed enforcement of the  laws on enterprises and labor unions alike. Both should be subjected to the anti-  trust laws; both should be treated alike with respect to laws about the  destruction of property and about interference with private activities.    Ill     Beyond this, the most important and effective step toward the reduction  of monopoly power would be an extensive reform of the tax laws. The corporate  tax should be abolished. Whether this is done or not, corporations should be  required to attribute to individual stockholders earnings which are not paid out as  dividends. That is, when the corporation sends out a dividend check, it should  also send a statement saying, ""In addition to this dividend of cents per share,  your corporation also earned cents per share which was reinvested."" The  individual stockholder should then be required to report the attributed but  undistributed earnings on his tax return as well as the dividend. Corporations  would still be free to plough back as much as they wish, but they would have no  incentive to do so except the proper incentive that they could earn more  internally than the stockholder could earn externally. Few measures would do  more to invigorate capital markets, to stimulate enterprise, and to promote  effective competition.   Of course, so long as the individual income tax is as highly graduated as it  is now, there is strong pressure to find devices to evade its impact. In this way  as well as directly, the highly graduated income tax constitutes a serious  impediment to the efficient use of our resources. The appropriate solution is the  drastic scaling down of the higher rates, combined with an elimination of the  avoidance devices that have been incorporated in the law.   Social Responsibility of Business and Labor   The view has been gaining widespread acceptance that corporate officials  and labor leaders have a ""social responsibility"" that goes beyond serving the  interest of their stockholders or their members. This view shows a fundamental  misconception of the character and nature of a free economy. In such an  economy, there is one and only one social responsibility of businessto use its  resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it  stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free  competition, without deception or fraud. Similarly, the ""social responsibility"" of  labor leaders is to serve the interests of the members of their unions. It is the  responsibility of the rest of us to establish a framework of law such that an  individual in pursuing his own interest is, to quote Adam Smith again, ""led by an  invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it  always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own  interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when  he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those  who affected to trade for the public good ."" 4   Few trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundations of our  free society as the acceptance by corporate officials of a social responsibility  other than to make as much money for their stockholders as possible. This is a    112     fundamentally subversive doctrine. If businessmen do have a social responsibility  other than making maximum profits for stockholders, how are they to know what  it is? Can self-selected private individuals decide what the social interest is? Can  they decide how great a burden they are justified in
placing on themselves or  their stockholders to serve that social interest? Is it tolerable that these public  functions of taxation, expenditure, and control be exercised by the people who  happen at the moment to be in charge of particular enterprises, chosen for those  posts by strictly private groups? If businessmen are civil servants rather than the  employees of their stockholders then in a democracy they will, sooner or later,  be chosen by the public techniques of election and appointment.   And long before this occurs, their decision-making power will have been  taken away from them. A dramatic illustration was the cancellation of a steel  price increase by U.S. Steel in April 1962 through the medium of a public display  of anger by President Kennedy and threats of reprisals on levels ranging from  anti-trust suits to examination of the tax reports of steel executives. This was a  striking episode because of the public display of the vast powers concentrated in  Washington. We were all made aware of how much of the power needed for a  police state was already available. It illustrates the present point as well. If the  price of steel is a public decision, as the doctrine of social responsibility declares,  then it cannot be permitted to be made privately.   The particular aspect of the doctrine which this example illustrates, and  which has been most prominent recently, is an alleged social responsibility of  business and labor to keep prices and wage rates down in order to avoid price  inflation. Suppose that at a time when there was upward pressure on prices  ultimately of course reflecting an increase in the stock of money every  businessman and labor leader were to accept this responsibility and suppose all  could succeed in keeping any price from rising, so we had voluntary price and  wage control without open inflation. What would be the result? Clearly product  shortages, labor shortages, gray markets, black markets. If prices are not  allowed to ration goods and workers, there must be some other means to do so.  Can the alternative rationing schemes be private? Perhaps for a time in a small  and unimportant area. But if the goods involved are many and important, there  will necessarily be pressure, and probably irresistible pressure, for governmental  rationing of goods, a governmental wage policy, and governmental measures for  allocating and distributing labor.   Price controls, whether legal or voluntary, if effectively enforced would  eventually lead to the destruction of the free-enterprise system and its  replacement by a centrally controlled system. And it would not even be effective  in preventing inflation. History offers ample evidence that what determines the  average level of prices and wages is the amount of money in the economy and  not the greediness of businessmen or of workers. Governments ask for the self-    113     restraint of business and labor because of their inability to manage their own  affairs which includes the control of money and the natural human tendency to  pass the buck.   One topic in the area of social responsibility that I feel duty-bound to  touch on, because it affects my own personal interests, has been the claim that  business should contribute to the support of charitable activities and especially to  universities. Such giving by corporations is an inappropriate use of corporate  funds in a free-enterprise society.   The corporation is an instrument of the stockholders who own it. If the  corporation makes a contribution, it prevents the individual stockholder from  himself deciding how he should dispose of his funds. With the corporation tax  and the deductibility of contributions, stockholders may of course want the  corporation to make a gift on their behalf, since this would enable them to make  a larger gift. The best solution would be the abolition of the corporate tax. But so  long as there is a corporate tax, there is no justification for permitting deductions  for contributions to charitable and educational institutions. Such contributions  should be made by the individuals who are the ultimate owners of property in  our society.   People who urge extension of the deductibility of this kind of corporate  contribution in the name of free enterprise are fundamentally working against  their own interest. A major complaint made frequently against modern business  is that it involves the separation of ownership and control that the corporation  has become a social institution that is a law unto itself, with irresponsible  executives who do not serve the interests of their stockholders. This charge is  not true. But the direction in which policy is now moving, of permitting  corporations to make contributions for charitable purposes and allowing  deductions for income tax, is a step in the direction of creating a true divorce  between ownership and control and of undermining the basic nature and  character of our society. It is a step away from an individualistic society and  toward the corporate state.",Capitalism and Freedom  Monopoly and the Social Responsibility of Business and Labor,"Friedman states, there are three alternatives for a monopoly: public monopoly, private monopoly, or public regulation. None of these is desirable or universally preferable. Monopolies come from many sources, but direct and indirect government intervention is the most common, and it should be stopped wherever possible. The doctrine of ""social responsibility"", that corporations should care about the community and not just profit, is highly subversive to the capitalist system and can only lead towards totalitarianism."
"The overthrow of the medieval guild system was an indispensable early  step in the rise of freedom in the Western world. It was a sign of the triumph of  liberal ideas, and widely recognized as such, that by the mid-nineteenth century,  in Britain, the United States, and to a lesser extent on the continent of Europe,  men could pursue whatever trade or occupation they wished without the by-  your-leave of any governmental or quasi-governmental authority. In more recent  decades, there has been a retrogression, an increasing tendency for particular  occupations to be restricted to individuals licensed to practice them by the state.   These restrictions on the freedom of individuals to use their resources as  they wish are important in their own right. In addition, they provide still a  different class of problems to which we can apply the principles developed in the  first two chapters.   I shall discuss first the general problem and then a particular example,  restrictions on the practice of medicine. The reason for choosing medicine is that  it seems desirable to discuss the restrictions for which the strongest case can be  made there is not much to be learned by knocking down straw men. I suspect  that most people, possibly even most liberals, believe that it is desirable to  restrict the practice of medicine to people who are licensed by the state. I agree  that the case for licensure is stronger for medicine than for most other fields. Yet  the conclusions I shall reach are that liberal principles do not justify licensure  even in medicine and that in practice the results of state licensure in medicine  have been undesirable.   Ubiquity of Governmental Restrictions on Economic Activities Men  May Engage in   Licensure is a special case of a much more general and exceedingly  widespread phenomenon, namely, edicts that individuals may not engage in  particular economic activities except under conditions laid down by a constituted  authority of the state. Medieval guilds were a particular example of an explicit  system for specifying which individuals should be permitted to follow particular  pursuits. The Indian caste system is another example. To a considerable extent  in the caste system, to a lesser extent in the guilds, the restrictions were  enforced by general social customs rather than explicitly by government.   A widespread notion about the caste system is that every person's  occupation is completely determined by the caste into which he is born. It is  obvious to an economist that this is an impossible system, since it prescribes a    116     rigid distribution of persons among occupations determined entirely by birthrates  and not at all by conditions of demand. Of course, this is not the way the system  worked. What was true, and to some measure still is, was that a limited number  of occupations were reserved to members of certain castes, but not every  member of those castes followed those occupations. There were some general  occupations, such as general agricultural work, which members of various castes  might engage in. These permitted an adjustment of the supply of people in  different occupations to the demand for their services.   Currently, tariffs, fair-trade laws, import quotas, production quotas, trade  union restrictions on employment and so on are examples of similar phenomena.  In all these cases, governmental authority determines the conditions under which  particular individuals can engage in particular activities, which is to say, the  terms on which some individuals are permitted to make arrangements with  others. The common feature of these examples, as well as of licensure, is that  the legislation is enacted on behalf of a producer group. For licensure, the  producer group is generally a craft. For the other examples, it may be a group  producing a particular product which wants a tariff, a group of small retailers  who would like to be protected from competition by the ""chiseling"" chain stores,  or a group of oil producers, of farmers, or of steel workers.   Occupational licensure is by now very widespread. According to Walter  Gellhorn, who has written the best brief survey I know, ""By 1952 more than 80  separate occupations exclusive of 'owner-businesses, 1 like restaurants and  taxicab companies, had been licensed by state law; and in addition to the state  laws there are municipal ordinances in abundance, not to mention the federal  statutes that require the licensing of such diverse occupations as radio operators  and stockyard commission agents. As long ago as 1938 a single state, North  Carolina, had extended its law to 60 occupations. One may not be surprised to  learn that pharmacists, accountants, and dentists have been reached by state  law as have sanitarians and psychologists, assayers and architects, veterinarians  and librarians. But with what joy of discovery does one learn about the licensing  of threshing machine operators and dealers in scrap tobacco? What of egg  graders and guide dog trainers, pest controllers and yacht salesmen, tree  surgeons and well diggers, tile layers and potato growers? And what of the  hypertrichologists who are licensed in Connecticut, where they remove excessive  and unsightly hair with the solemnity appropriate to their high sounding title?"" 1  In the arguments that seek to persuade legislatures to enact such licensure  provisions, the justification is always said to be the necessity of protecting the  public interest. Flowever, the pressure on the legislature to license an occupation  rarely comes from the members of the public who have been mulcted or in other  ways abused by members of the occupation. On the contrary, the pressure  invariably comes from members of the occupation itself. Of course, they are    117     more aware than others of how much they exploit the customer and so perhaps  they can lay claim to expert knowledge.   Similarly, the arrangements made for licensure almost invariably involve  control by members of the occupation which is to be licensed. Again, this is in  some ways quite natural. If the occupation of plumbing is to be restricted to  those who have the requisite capacity and skills to provide good service for their  customers, clearly only plumbers are capable of judging who should be licensed.  Consequently, the board or other body that grants licenses is almost invariably  made up largely of plumbers or pharmacists or physicians or whatever may be  the particular occupation licensed.   Gellhorn points out that ""Seventy-five per cent of the occupational  licensing boards at work in this country today are composed exclusively of  licensed practitioners in the respective occupations. These men and women,  most of whom are only part-time officials, may have a direct economic interest in  many of the decisions they make concerning admission requirements and the  definition of standards to be observed by licensees. More importantly, they are  as a rule directly representative of organized groups within the occupations.  Ordinarily they are nominated by these groups as a step toward a gubernatorial  or other appointment that is frequently a mere formality. Often the formality is  dispensed with entirely, appointment being made directly by the occupational  association as happens, for example, with the embalmers in North Carolina, the  dentists in Alabama, the psychologists in Virginia, the physicians in Maryland,  and the attorneys in Washington."" 2   Licensure therefore frequently establishes essentially the medieval guild  kind of regulation in which the state assigns power to the members of the  profession. In practice, the considerations taken into account in determining who  shall get a license often involve matters that, so far as a layman can see, have  no relation whatsoever to professional competence. This is not surprising. If a  few individuals are going to decide whether other individuals may pursue an  occupation, all sorts of irrelevant considerations are likely to enter. J ust what the  irrelevant considerations will be, will depend on the personalities of the members  of the licensing board and the mood of the time. Gellhorn notes the extent to  which a loyalty oath was required of various occupations when the fear of  communist subversion was sweeping the country. He writes, ""A Texas statute of  1952 requires each applicant for a pharmacist's license to swear that 'he is not a  member of the Communist Party or affiliated with such party, and that he does  not believe in and is neither a member of nor supports any group or organization  that believes in, furthers or teaches the overthrow of the United States  Government by force or any illegal or unconstitutional methods.' The relationship  between this oath on the one hand and, on the other, the public health which is  the interest purportedly protected by the licensing of pharmacists, is somewhat    118     obscure. No more apparent is the justification for requiring professional boxers  and wrestlers in I ndiana to swear that they are not subversive ... A junior high  school teacher of music, having been forced to resign after being identified as a  Communist, had difficulty becoming a piano tuner in the District of Columbia  because, forsooth, he was 'under Communist discipline.' Veterinarians in the  state of Washington may not minister to an ailing cow or cat unless they have  first signed a non-Communist oath."" 3   Whatever one's attitude towards communism, any relationship between  the requirements imposed and the qualities which the licensure is intended to  assure is rather far-fetched. The extent to which such requirements go is  sometimes little short of ludicrous. A few more quotations from Gellhorn may  provide a touch of comic relief. 4   One of the most amusing sets of regulations is that laid down for barbers,  a trade that is licensed in many places. Here is an example from a law which was  declared invalid by Maryland courts, though similar language can be found in  statutes of other states which were declared legal. ""The court was depressed  rather than impressed by a legislative command that neophyte barbers must  receive formal instruction in the 'scientific fundamentals for barbering, hygiene,  bacteriology, histology of the hair, skin, nails, muscles and nerves, structure of  the head, face and neck, elementary chemistry relating to sterilization and  antiseptics, disease of the skin, hair, glands and nails, haircutting, shaving and  arranging, dressing, coloring, bleaching, and tinting of the hair'. ""5 One more  quotation on the barbers: ""Of eighteen representative states included in a study  of barbering regulations in 1929, not one then commanded an aspirant to be a  graduate of a 'barber college,' though apprenticeship was necessary in all.  Today, the states typically insist upon graduation from a barbering school that  provides not less (and often much more) than one thousand hours of instruction  in 'theoretical subjects' such as sterilization of instruments, and this must still be  followed by apprenticeship."" 6 I trust these quotations make it clear that the  problem of licensing of occupations is something more than a trivial illustration of  the problem of state intervention, that it is already in this country a serious  infringement on the freedom of individuals to pursue activities of their own  choice, and that it threatens to become a much more serious one with the  continual pressure upon legislatures to extend it.   Before discussing the advantages and disadvantages of licensing, it is  worth noting why we have it and what general political problem is revealed by  the tendency for such special legislation to be enacted. The declaration by a  large number of different state legislatures that barbers must be approved by a  committee of other barbers is hardly persuasive evidence that there is in fact a  public interest in having such legislation. Surely the explanation is different; it is  that a producer group tends to be more concentrated politically than a consumer    119     group. This is an obvious point often made and yet one whose importance  cannot be overstressed. 7 Each of us is a producer and also a consumer.  However, we are much more specialized and devote a much larger fraction of  our attention to our activity as a producer than as a consumer. We consume  literally thousands if not millions of items. The result is that people in the same  trade, like barbers or physicians, all have an intense interest in the specific  problems of this trade and are willing to devote considerable energy to doing  something about them. On the other hand, those of us who use barbers at all,  get barbered infrequently and spend only a minor fraction of our income in  barber shops. Our interest is casual. Hardly any of us are willing to devote much  time going to the legislature in order to testify against the iniquity of restricting  the practice of barbering. The same point holds for tariffs. The groups that think  they have a special interest in particular tariffs are concentrated groups to whom  the issue makes a great deal of difference. The public interest is widely  dispersed. In consequence, in the absence of any general arrangements to offset  the pressure of special interests, producer groups will invariably have a much  stronger influence on legislative action and the powers that be than will the  diverse, widely spread consumer interest. Indeed from this point of view, the  puzzle is not why we have so many silly licensure laws, but why we don't have  far more. The puzzle is how we ever succeeded in getting the relative freedom  from government controls over the productive activities of individuals that we  have had and still have in this country, and that other countries have had as  well.    The only way that I can see to offset special producer groups is to  establish a general presumption against the state undertaking certain kinds of  activities. Only if there is a general recognition that governmental activities  should be severely limited with respect to a class of cases, can the burden of  proof be put strongly enough on those who would depart from this general  presumption to give a reasonable hope of limiting the spread of special measures  to further special interests. This point is one we have adverted to time and  again. It is of a piece with the argument for the Bill of Rights and for a rule to  govern monetary policy and fiscal policy.   Policy Issues Raised by Licensure   It is important to distinguish three different levels of control: first,  registration; second, certification; third, licensing.   By registration, I mean an arrangement under which individuals are  required to list their names in some official register if they engage in certain  kinds of activities. There is no provision for denying the right to engage in the  activity to anyone who is willing to list his name. He may be charged a fee, either  as a registration fee or as a scheme of taxation.    120     The second level is certification. The governmental agency may certify  that an individual has certain skills but may not prevent, in any way, the practice  of any occupation using these skills by people who do not have such a  certificate. One example is accountancy. In most states, anybody can be an  accountant, whether he is a certified public accountant or not, but only those  people who have passed a particular test can put the title CPA after their names  or can put a sign in their offices saying they are certified public accountants.  Certification is frequently only an intermediate stage. In many states, there has  been a tendency to restrict an increasing range of activities to certified public  accountants. With respect to such activities there is licensure, not certification. In  some states, ""architect"" is a title which can be used only by those who have  passed a specified examination. This is certification. It does not prevent anyone  else from going into the business of advising people for a fee how to build  houses.   The third stage is licensing proper. This is an arrangement under which  one must obtain a license from a recognized authority in order to engage in the  occupation. The license is more than a formality. It requires
some demonstration  of competence or the meeting of some tests ostensibly designed to insure  competence, and anyone who does not have a license is not authorized to  practice and is subject to a fine or a jail sentence if he does engage in practice.   The question I want to consider is this: under what circumstances, if any,  can we justify the one or the other of these steps? There are three different  grounds on which it seems to me registration can be justified consistently with  liberal principles.   First, it may assist in the pursuit of other aims. Let me illustrate. The  police are often concerned with acts of violence. After the event, it is desirable to  find out who had access to firearms. Before the event, it is desirable to prevent  firearms from getting into the hands of people who are likely to use them for  criminal purposes. It may assist in the pursuit of this aim to register stores selling  firearms. Of course, if I may revert to a point made several times in earlier  chapters, it is never enough to say that there might be a justification along these  lines, in order to conclude that there is justification. It is necessary to set up a  balance sheet of the advantages and disadvantages in the light of liberal  principles. All I am now saying is that this consideration might in some cases  justify overriding the general presumption against requiring the registration of  people.   Second, registration is sometimes a device to facilitate taxation and  nothing more. The questions at issue then become whether the particular tax is  an appropriate method to raise revenue for financing government services    121     regarded as necessary, and whether registration facilitates the collection of  taxes. It may do so either because a tax is imposed on the person who registers,  or because the person who registers is used as a tax collector. For example, in  collecting a sales tax imposed on various items of consumption, it is necessary to  have a register or list of all the places selling goods subject to the tax.   Third, and this is the one possible justification for registration which is  close to our main interest, registration may be a means to protect consumers  against fraud. In general, liberal principles assign to the state the power to  enforce contracts, and fraud involves the violation of a contract. It is, of course,  dubious that one should go very far to protect in advance against fraud because  of the interference with voluntary contracts involved in doing so. But I do not  think that one can rule out on grounds of principle the possibility that there may  be certain activities that are so likely to give rise to fraud as to render it desirable  to have in advance a list of people known to be pursuing this activity. Perhaps  one example along these lines is the registration of taxicab drivers. A taxicab  driver picking up a person at night may be in a particularly good position to steal  from him. To inhibit such practices, it may be desirable to have a list of names of  people who are engaged in the taxicab business, to give each a number, and to  require that this number be put in the cab so that anyone molested need only  remember the number of the cab. This involves simply the use of the police  power to protect individuals against violence on the part of other individuals and  may be the most convenient method of doing so.   Certification is much more difficult to justify. The reason is that this is  something the private market generally can do for itself. This problem is the  same for products as for people's services. There are private certification  agencies in many areas that certify the competence of a person or the quality of  a particular product. The Good Housekeeping seal is a private certification  arrangement. For industrial products there are private testing laboratories that  will certify to the quality of a particular product. For consumer products, there  are consumer testing agencies of which Consumer's Union and Consumer's  Research are the best known in the United States. Better Business Bureaus are  voluntary organizations that certify the quality of particular dealers. Technical  schools, colleges, and universities certify the quality of their graduates. One  function of retailers and department stores is to certify the quality of the many  items they sell. The consumer develops confidence in the store, and the store in  turn has an incentive to earn this confidence by investigating the quality of the  items it sells.   One can however argue that in some cases, or perhaps even in many,  voluntary certification will not be carried as far as individuals would be willing to  pay for carrying it because of the difficulty of keeping the certification  confidential. The issue is essentially the one involved in patents and copyrights,    122     namely, whether individuals are in a position to capture the value of the services  that they render to others. If I go into the business of certifying people, there  may be no efficient way in which I can require you to pay for my certification. If  I sell my certification information to one person, how can I keep him from  passing it on to others? Consequently, it may not be possible to get effective  voluntary exchange with respect to certification, even though this is a service  that people would be willing to pay for if they had to. One way to get around this  problem, as we get around other kinds of neighborhood effects, is to have  governmental certification.   Another possible justification for certification is on monopoly grounds.  There are some technical monopoly aspects to certification, since the cost of  making a certification is largely independent of the number of people to whom  the information is transmitted. However, it is by no means clear that monopoly is  inevitable.   Licensure seems to me still more difficult to justify. It goes still farther in  the direction of trenching upon the rights of individuals to enter into voluntary  contracts. Nonetheless, there are some justifications given for licensure that the  liberal will have to recognize as within his own conception of appropriate  government action, though, as always, the advantages have to be weighed  against the disadvantages. The main argument that is relevant to a liberal is the  existence of neighborhood effects. The simplest and most obvious example is the  ""incompetent"" physician who produces an epidemic. Insofar as he harms only his  patient, that is simply a question of voluntary contract and exchange between  the patient and his physician. On this score, there is no ground for intervention.  However, it can be argued that if the physician treats his patient badly, he may  unleash an epidemic that will cause harm to third parties who are not involved in  the immediate transaction. In such a case, it is conceivable that everybody,  including even the potential patient and physician, would be willing to submit to  the restriction of the practice of medicine to ""competent"" people in order to  prevent such epidemics from occurring.   In practice, the major argument given for licensure by its proponents is  not this one, which has some appeal to a liberal, but rather a strictly paternalistic  argument that has little or no appeal. Individuals, it is said, are incapable of  choosing their own servants adequately, their own physician or plumber or  barber. In order for a man to choose a physician intelligently, he would have to  be a physician himself. Most of us, it is said, are therefore incompetent and we  must be protected against our own ignorance. This amounts to saying that we in  our capacity as voters must protect ourselves in our capacity as consumers  against our own ignorance, by seeing to it that people are not served by  incompetent physicians or plumbers or barbers.    123     So far, I have been listing the arguments for registration, certification, and  licensing. In all three cases, it is clear that there are also strong social costs to be  set against any of these advantages. Some of these social costs have already  been suggested and I shall illustrate them in more detail for medicine, but it may  be worth recording them here in general form.   The most obvious social cost is that any one of these measures, whether  it be registration, certification, or licensure, almost inevitably becomes a tool in  the hands of a special producer group to obtain a monopoly position at the  expense of the rest of the public. There is no way to avoid this result. One can  devise one or another set of procedural controls designed to avert this outcome,  but none is likely to overcome the problem that arises out of the greater  concentration of producer than of consumer interest. The people who are most  concerned with any such arrangement, who will press most for its enforcement  and be most concerned with its administration, will be the people in the  particular occupation or trade involved. They will inevitably press for the  extension of registration to certification and of certification to licensure. Once  licensure is attained, the people who might develop an interest in undermining  the regulations are kept from exerting their influence. They don't get a license,  must therefore go into other occupations, and will lose interest. The result is  invariably control over entry by members of the occupation itself and hence the  establishment of a monopoly position.   Certification is much less harmful in this respect. If the certified ""abuse""  their special certificates; if, in certifying newcomers, members of the trade  impose unnecessarily stringent requirements and reduce the number of  practitioners too much, the price differential between certified and non-certified  will become sufficiently large to induce the public to use non-certified  practitioners. In technical terms, the elasticity of demand for the services of  certified practitioners will be fairly large, and the limits within which they can  exploit the rest of the public by taking advantage of their special position will be  rather narrow.   In consequence, certification without licensure is a half-way house that  maintains a good deal of protection against monopolization. It also has its  disadvantages, but it is worth noting that the usual arguments for licensure, and  in particular the paternalistic arguments, are satisfied almost entirely by  certification alone. If the argument is that we are too ignorant to judge good  practitioners, all that is needed is to make the relevant information available. If,  in full knowledge, we still want to go to someone who is not certified, that is our  business; we cannot complain that we did not have the information. Since  arguments for licensure made by people who are not members of the occupation  can be satisfied so fully by certification, I personally find it difficult to see any  case for which licensure rather than certification can be justified.    124     Even registration has significant social costs. It is an important first step in  the direction of a system in which every individual has to carry an identity card,  every individual has to inform authorities what he plans to do before he does it.  Moreover, as already noted, registration tends to be the first step toward  certification and licensure.   Medical Licensure   The medical profession is one in which practice of the profession has for a  long time been restricted to people with licenses. Offhand, the question, ""Ought  we to let incompetent physicians practice?"" seems to admit of only a negative  answer. But I want to urge that second thought may give pause.   In the first place, licensure is the key to the control that the medical  profession can exercise over the number of physicians. To understand why this is  so requires some discussion of the structure of the medical profession. The  American Medical Association is perhaps the strongest trade union in the United  States. The essence of the power of a trade union is its power to restrict the  number who may engage in a particular occupation. This restriction may be  exercised indirectly by being able to enforce a wage rate higher than would  otherwise prevail. If such a wage rate can be enforced, it will reduce the number  of people who can get jobs and thus indirectly the number of people pursuing  the occupation. This technique of restriction has disadvantages. There is always  a dissatisfied fringe of people who are trying to get into the occupation. A trade  union is much better off if it can limit directly the number of people who enter  the occupation who ever try to get jobs in it. The disgruntled and dissatisfied are  excluded at the outset, and the union does not have to worry about them.   The American Medical Association is in this position. It is a trade union  that can limit the number of people who can enter. How can it do this? The  essential control is at the stage of admission to medical school. The Council on  Medical Education and Hospitals of the American Medical Association approves  medical schools. In order for a medical school to get and stay on its list of  approved schools it has to meet the standards of the Council. The power of the  Council has been demonstrated at various times when there has been pressure  to reduce numbers. For example, in the 1930's during the depression, the  Council on Medical Education and Hospitals wrote a letter to the various medical  schools saying the medical schools were admitting more students than could be  given the proper kind of training. In the next year or two, every school reduced  the number it was admitting, giving very strong presumptive evidence that the  recommendation had some effect.    125     Why does the Council's approval matter so much? If it abuses its power,  why don't unapproved medical schools arise? The answer is that in almost every  state in the United States, a person must be licensed to practice medicine, and to  get the license, he must be a graduate of an approved school. In almost every  state, the list of approved schools is identical with the list of schools approved by  the Council on Medical Education and Hospitals of the American Medical  Association. That is why the licensure provision is the key to the effective control  of admission. It has a dual effect. On the one hand, the members of the  licensure commission are always physicians and hence have some control at the  step at which men apply for a license. This control is more limited in  effectiveness than control at the medical school level. In almost all professions  requiring licensure, people may try to get admitted more than once. If a person  tries long enough and in enough jurisdictions he is likely to get through sooner or  later. Since he has already spent the money and time to get his training, he has  a strong incentive to keep trying. Licensure provisions that come into operation  only after a man is trained therefore affect entry largely by raising the costs of  getting into the occupation, since it may take a longer time to get in and since  there is always some uncertainty whether he will succeed. But this rise in cost is  nothing like so effective in limiting entry as is preventing a man from getting  started on his career. If he is eliminated at the stage of entering medical school,  he never comes up as a candidate for examination; he can never be troublesome  at that stage. The efficient way to get control over the number in a profession is  therefore to get control of entry into professional schools.   Control over admission to medical school and later licensure enables the  profession to limit entry in two ways. The obvious one is simply by turning down  many applicants. The less obvious, but probably far more important one, is by  establishing standards for admission and licensure that make entry so difficult as  to discourage young people from ever trying to get admission. Though most  state laws require only two years of college prior to medical school, nearly 100  per cent of the entrants have had four years of college. Similarly, medical  training proper has been lengthened, particularly through more stringent  internship arrangements.   As an aside, the lawyers have never been as su
cessful as the physicians  in getting control at the point of admission to professional school, though they  are moving in that direction. The reason is amusing. Almost every school on the  American Bar Association's list of approved schools is a full time day school;  almost no night schools are approved. Many state legislators, on the other hand,  are graduates of night law schools. If they voted to restrict admission to the  profession to graduates of approved schools, in effect they would be voting that  they themselves were not qualified. Their reluctance to condemn their own  competence has been the main factor that has tended to limit the extent to  which law has been able to succeed in imitating medicine. I have not myself    126     done any extensive work on requirements for admission to law for many years  but I understand that this limitation is breaking down. The greater affluence of  students means that a much larger fraction are going to full time law schools and  this is changing the composition of the legislatures.   To return to medicine, it is the provision about graduation from approved  schools that is the most important source of professional control over entry. The  profession has used this control to limit numbers. To avoid misunderstanding let  me emphasize that I am not saying that individual members of the medical  profession, the leaders of the medical profession, or the people who are in  charge of the Council on Medical Education and Hospitals deliberately go out of  their way to limit entry in order to raise their own incomes. That is not the way it  works. Even when such people explicitly comment on the desirability of limiting  numbers to raise incomes they will always justify the policy on the grounds that  if ""too"" many people are let in, this will lower their incomes so that they will be  driven to resort to unethical practices in order to earn a ""proper"" income. The  only way, they argue, in which ethical practices can be maintained is by keeping  people at a standard of income which is adequate to the merits and needs of the  medical profession. I must confess that this has always seemed to me  objectionable on both ethical and factual grounds. It is extraordinary that leaders  of medicine should proclaim publicly that they and their colleagues must be paid  to be ethical. And if it were so, I doubt that the price would have any limit. There  seems little correlation between poverty and honesty. One would rather expect  the opposite; dishonesty may not always pay but surely it sometimes does.   Control of entry is explicitly rationalized along these lines only at times like  the Great Depression when there is much unemployment and relatively low  incomes. In ordinary times, the rationalization for restriction is different. It is that  the members of the medical profession want to raise what they regard as the  standards of ""quality"" of the profession. The defect in this rationalization is a  common one, and one that is destructive of a proper understanding of the  operation of an economic system, namely, the failure to distinguish between  technical efficiency and economic efficiency.   A story about lawyers will perhaps illustrate the point. At a meeting of  lawyers at which problems of admission were being discussed, a colleague of  mine, arguing against restrictive admission standards, used an analogy from the  automobile industry. Would it not, he said, be absurd if the automobile industry  were to argue that no one should drive a low quality car and therefore that no  automobile manufacturer should be permitted to produce a car that did not come  up to the Cadillac standard. One member of the audience rose and approved the  analogy, saying that, of course, the country cannot afford anything but Cadillac  lawyers! This tends to be the professional attitude. The members look solely at  technical standards of performance, and argue in effect that we must have only    127     firstrate physicians even if this means that some people get no medical service  though of course they never put it that way. Nonetheless, the view that people  should get only the ""optimum"" medical service always lead to a restrictive policy,  a policy that keeps down the number of physicians. I would not, of course, want  to argue that this is the only force at work, but only that this kind of  consideration leads many well-meaning physicians to go along with policies that  they would reject out-of-hand if they did not have this kind of comforting  rationalization.   It is easy to demonstrate that quality is only a rationalization and not the  underlying reason for restriction. The power of the Council on Medical Education  and Hospitals of the American Medical Association has been used to limit  numbers in ways that cannot possibly have any connection whatsoever with  quality. The simplest example is their recommendation to various states that  citizenship be made a requirement for the practice of medicine. I find it  inconceivable to see how this is relevant to medical performance. A similar  requirement that they have tried to impose on occasion is that examination for  licensure must be taken in English. A dramatic piece of evidence on the power  and potency of the Association as well as on the lack of relation to quality is  proved by one figure that I have always found striking. After 1933, when Hitler  came to power in Germany, there was a tremendous outflow of professional  people from Germany, Austria and so on, including of course, physicians who  wanted to practice in the United States. The number of physicians trained abroad  who were admitted to practice in the United States in the five years after 1933  was the same as in the five years before. This was clearly not the result of the  natural course of events. The threat of these additional physicians led to a  stringent tightening of requirements for foreign physicians that imposed extreme  costs upon them.   It is clear that licensure is the key to the medical profession's ability to  restrict the number of physicians who practice medicine. It is also the key to its  ability to restrict technological and organizational changes in the way medicine is  conducted. The American Medical Association has been consistently against the  practice of group medicine, and against prepaid medical plans. These methods of  practice may have good features and bad features, but they are technological  innovations that people ought to be free to try out if they wish. There is no basis  for saying conclusively that the optimum technical method of organizing medical  practice is practice by an independent physician. Maybe it is group practice,  maybe it is by corporations. One ought to have a system under which all  varieties can be tried.   The American Medical Association has resisted such attempts and has  been able effectively to inhibit them. It has been able to do so because licensure  has indirectly given it control of admission to practice in hospitals. The Council on    128     Medical Education and Hospitals approves hospitals as well as medical schools.  In order for a physician to get admission to practice in an ""approved"" hospital,  he must generally be approved by his county medical association or by the  hospital board. Why can't unapproved hospitals be set up? Because under  present economic conditions, in order for a hospital to operate it must have a  supply of interns. Under most state licensure laws, candidates must have some  internship experience to be admitted to practice, and internship must be in an  ""approved"" hospital. The list of ""approved"" hospitals is generally identical with  that of the Council on Medical Education and Hospitals. Consequently, the  licensure law gives the profession control over hospitals as well as over schools.  This is the key to the AMA's largely successful opposition to various types of  group practice. In a few cases, the groups have been able to survive. In the  District of Columbia, they succeeded because they were able to bring suit against  the American Medical Association under the federal Sherman antitrust laws, and  won the suit. In a few other cases, they have succeeded for special reasons.  There is, however, no doubt that the tendency toward group practice has been  greatly retarded by the AMA's opposition.   It is interesting, and this is an aside, that the medical association is  against only one type of group practice, namely, prepaid group practice. The  economic reason seems to be that this eliminates the possibility of engaging in  discriminatory pricing . 8   It is clear that licensure has been at the core of the restriction of entry  and that this involves a heavy social cost, both to the individuals who want to  practice medicine but are prevented from doing so and to the public deprived of  the medical care it wants to buy and is prevented from buying. Let me now ask  the question: Does licensure have the good effects that it is said to have?   In the first place, does it really raise standards of competence? It is by no  means clear that it does raise the standards of competence in the actual practice  of the profession for several reasons. In the first place, whenever you establish a  block to entry into any field, you establish an incentive to find ways of getting  around it, and of course medicine is no exception. The rise of the professions of  osteopathy and of chiropractic is not unrelated to the restriction of entry into  medicine. On the contrary, each of these represented, to some extent, an  attempt to find a way around restriction of entry. Each of these, in turn, is  proceeding to get itself licensed, and to impose restrictions. The effect is to  create different levels and kinds of practice, to distinguish between what is called  medical practice and substitutes such as osteopathy, chiropractic, faith healing  and so on. These alternatives may well be of lower quality than medical practice  would have been without the restrictions on entry into medicine.    129     More generally, if the number of physicians is less than it otherwise would  be, and if they are all fully occupied, as they generally are, this means that there  is a smaller total of medical practice by trained physicians fewer medical man-  hours of practice, as it were. The alternative is untrained practice by somebody;  it may and in part must be by people who have no professional qualifications at  all. Moreover, the situation is much more extreme. If ""medical practice"" is to be  limited to licensed practitioners, it is necessary to define what medical practice is,  and featherbedding is not something that is restricted to the railroads. Under the  interpretation of the statutes forbidding unauthorized practice of medicine, many  things are restricted to licensed physicians that could perfectly well be done by  technicians, and other skilled people who do not have a Cadillac medical training.  I am not enough of a technician to list the examples at all fully. I only know that  those who have looked into the question say that the tendency is to include in  ""medical practice"" a wider and wider range of activities that could perfectly well  be performed by technicians. Trained physicians devote a considerable part of  their time to things that might well be done by others. The result is to reduce  drastically the amount of medical care. The relevant average quality of medical  care, if one can at all conceive of the concept, cannot be obtained by simply  averaging the quality of care that is given; that would be like judging the  effectiveness of a medical treatment by considering only the survivors; one must  also allow for the fact that the restrictions reduce the amount of care. The result  may well be that the average level of competence in a meaningful sense has  been reduced by the restrictions.   Even these comments do not go far enough, because they consider the  situation at a point in time and do not allow for changes over time. Advances in  any science or field often result from the work of one out of a large number of  crackpots and quacks and people who have no standing in the profession. In the  medical profession, under present circumstances, it is very difficult to engage in  research or experimentation unless you are a member of the profession. If you  are a member of the profession and want to stay in good standing in the  profession, you are seriously limited in the kind of experimentation you can do. A  ""faith healer"" may be just a quack who is imposing himself on credulous patients,  but maybe one in a thousand or in many thousands will produce an important  improvement in medicine. There are many different routes to knowledge and  learning and the effect of restricting the practice of what is called medicine and  defining it as we tend to do to a particular group, who in the main have to  conform to the prevailing orthodoxy, is certain to reduce the amount of  experimentation that goes on and hence to reduce the rate of growth of  knowledge in the area. What is true for the content of medicine is true also for  its organization, as has already been suggested. I shall expand further on this  point below.    130     There is still another way in which licensure, and the associated monopoly  in the practice of medicine, tend to render standards of practice low. I have  already suggested that it renders the average quality of practice low by reducing  the number of physicians, by reducing the aggregate number of hours available  from trained physicians for more rather than less important tasks, and by  reducing the incentive for research and development. It renders it low also by  making it much more difficult for private individuals to collect from physicians for  malpractice. One of the protections of the individual citizen against incompetence  is protection against fraud and the ability to bring suit in the court against  malpractice. Some suits are brought, and physicians complain a great deal about  how much they have to pay for malpractice insurance. Yet suits for malpractice  are fewer and less successful than they would be were it not for the watchful eye  of the medical associations. It is not easy to get a physician to testify against a  fellow physician when he faces the sanction of being denied the right to practice  in an ""approved"" hospital. The testimony generally has to come from members  of panels set up by medical associations themselves, always, of course, in the  alleged interest of the patients.   When these effects are taken into account, I am myself persuaded that  licensure has reduced both the quantity and quality of medical practice; that it  has reduced the opportunities available to people who would like to be  physicians, forcing them to pursue occupations they regard as less attractive;  that it has forced the public to pay more for less satisfactory medical service, and  that it has retarded technological development both in medicine itself and in the  organization of medical practice. I conclude that licensure should be eliminated  as a requirement for the practice of medicine.   When all this is said, many a reader, I suspect, like many a person with  whom I have discussed these issues, will say, ""But still, how else would I get any  evidence on the quality of a physician. Granted all that you say about costs, is  not licensure the only way of providing the public with some assurance of at  least minimum quality ?"" The answer is partly that people do not now choose  physicians by picking names at random from a list of licensed physicians; partly,  that a man's ability to pass an examination twenty or thirty years earlier is hardly  assurance of quality now; hence, licensure is not now the main or even a major  source of assurance of at least minimum quality. But the major answer is very  different. It is that the question itself reveals the tyranny of the status quo and  the poverty of our imagination in fields in which we are laymen, and even in  those in which we have some competence, by comparison with the fertility of the  market. Let me illustrate by speculating on how medicine might have developed  and what assurances of quality would have emerged, if the profession had not  exerted mono
oly power.    131     Suppose that anyone had been free to practice medicine without  restriction except for legal and financial responsibility for any harm done to  others through fraud and negligence. I conjecture that the whole development of  medicine would have been different. The present market for medical care,  hampered as it has been, gives some hints of what the difference would have  been. Group practice in conjunction with hospitals would have grown  enormously. Instead of individual practice plus large institutional hospitals  conducted by governments or eleemosynary institutions, there might have  developed medical partnerships or corporations medical teams. These would  have provided central diagnostic and treatment facilities, including hospital  facilities. Some presumably would have been prepaid, combining in one package  present hospital insurance, health insurance, and group medical practice. Others  would have charged separate fees for separate services. And of course, most  might have used both methods of payment.   These medical teams department stores of medicine, if you will would be  intermediaries between the patients and the physician. Being long-lived and  immobile, they would have a great interest in establishing a reputation for  reliability and quality. For the same reason, consumers would get to know their  reputation. They would have the specialized skill to judge the quality of  physicians; indeed, they would be the agent of the consumer in doing so, as the  department store is now for many a product. In addition, they could organize  medical care efficiently, combining medical men of different degrees of skill and  training, using technicians with limited training for tasks for which they were  suited, and reserving highly skilled and competent specialists for the tasks they  alone could perform. The reader can add further flourishes for himself, drawing  in part, as I have done, on what now goes on at the leading medical clinics.   Of course, not all medical practice would be done through such teams.  Individual private practice would continue, just as the small store with a limited  clientele exists alongside the department store, the individual lawyer alongside  the great many-partnered firm. Men would establish individual reputations and  some patients would prefer the privacy and intimacy of the individual  practitioner. Some areas would be too small to be served by medical teams. And  so on.    I would not even want to maintain that the medical teams would  dominate the field. My aim is only to show by example that there are many  alternatives to the present organization of practice. The impossibility of any  individual or small group conceiving of all the possibilities, let alone evaluating  their merits, is the great argument against central governmental planning and  against arrangements such as professional monopolies that limit the possibilities  of experimentation. On the other side, the great argument for the market is its  tolerance of diversity; its ability to utilize a wide range of special knowledge and    132     capacity. It renders special groups impotent to prevent experimentation and  permits the customers and not the producers to decide what will serve the  customers best.",Capitalism and Freedom  Occupational Licensure,"This economist takes a radical stance against all forms of state licensure. The biggest advocates for licenses in an industry are, usually, the people in the industry, wishing to keep out potential competitors. The author defines registration, certification, and licensing, and, in the context of doctors, explains why the case for each one of these is weaker than the previous one. There is no liberal justification for licensing doctors; it results in inferior care and a medical cartel."
"A central element in the development of a collectivist sentiment in this  century, at least in Western countries, has been a belief in equality of income as  a social goal and a willingness to use the arm of the state to promote it. Two  very different questions must be asked in evaluating this egalitarian sentiment  and the egalitarian measures it has produced. The first is normative and ethical:  what is the justification for state intervention to promote equality? The second is  positive and scientific: what has been the effect of the measures actually taken?   The Ethics of Distribution   The ethical principle that would directly justify the distribution of income  in a free market society is, ""To each according to what he and the instruments  he owns produces."" The operation of even this principle implicitly depends on  state action. Property rights are matters of law and social convention. As we  have seen, their definition and enforcement is one of the primary functions of  the state. The final distribution of income and wealth under the full operation of  this principle may well depend markedly on the rules of property adopted.   What is the relation between this principle and another that seems  ethically appealing, namely, equality of treatment? In part, the two principles are  not contradictory. Payment in accordance with product may be necessary to  achieve true equality of treatment. Given individuals whom we are prepared to  regard as alike in ability and initial resources, if some have a greater taste for  leisure and others for marketable goods, inequality of return through the market  is necessary to achieve equality of total return or equality of treatment. One man  may prefer a routine job with much time off for basking in the sun to a more  exacting job paying a higher salary; another man may prefer the opposite. If  both were paid equally in money, their incomes in a more fundamental sense  would be unequal. Similarly, equal treatment requires that an individual be paid  more for a dirty, unattractive job than for a pleasant rewarding one. Much  observed inequality is of this kind. Differences of money income offset  differences in other characteristics of the occupation or trade. In the jargon of  economists, they are ""equalizing differences"" required to make the whole of the  ""net advantages,"" pecuniary and non-pecuniary, the same.   Another kind of inequality arising through the operation of the market is  also required, in a somewhat more subtle sense, to produce equality of  treatment, or to put it differently to satisfy men's tastes. It can be illustrated  most simply by a lottery. Consider a group of individuals who initially have equal  endowments and who all agree voluntarily to enter a lottery with very unequal    134     prizes. The resultant inequality of income is surely required to permit the  individuals in question to make the most of their initial equality. Redistribution of  the income after the event is equivalent to denying them the opportunity to  enter the lottery. This case is far more important in practice than would appear  by taking the notion of a ""lottery"" literally. Individuals choose occupations,  investments, and the like partly in accordance with their taste for uncertainty.  The girl who tries to become a movie actress rather than a civil servant is  deliberately choosing to enter a lottery, so is the individual who invests in penny  uranium stocks rather than government bonds. Insurance is a way of expressing  a taste for certainty. Even these examples do not indicate fully the extent to  which actual inequality may be the result of arrangements designed to satisfy  men's tastes. The very arrangements for paying and hiring people are affected  by such preferences. If all potential movie actresses had a great dislike of  uncertainty, there would tend to develop ""co-operatives"" of movie actresses, the  members of which agreed in advance to share income receipts more or less  evenly, thereby in effect providing themselves insurance through the pooling of  risks. If such a preference were widespread, large diversified corporations  combining risky and non-risky ventures would become the rule. The wild-cat oil  prospector, the private proprietorship, the small partnership, would all become  rare.    Indeed, this is one way to interpret governmental measures to redistribute  income through progressive taxes and the like. It can be argued that for one  reason or another, costs of administration perhaps, the market cannot produce  the range of lotteries or the kind of lottery desired by the members of the  community, and that progressive taxation is, as it were, a government enterprise  to do so. I have no doubt that this view contains an element of truth. At the  same time, it can hardly justify present taxation, if only because the taxes are  imposed after it is already largely known who have drawn the prizes and who the  blanks in the lottery of life, and the taxes are voted mostly by those who think  they have drawn the blanks. One might, along these lines, justify one  generation's voting the tax schedules to be applied to an as yet unborn  generation. Any such procedure would, I conjecture, yield income tax schedules  much less highly graduated than present schedules are, at least on paper.   Though much of the inequality of income produced by payment in  accordance with product reflects ""equalizing"" differences or the satisfaction of  men's tastes for uncertainty, a large part reflects initial differences in  endowment, both of human capacities and of property. This is the part that  raises the really difficult ethical issue.   It is widely argued that it is essential to distinguish between inequality in  personal endowments and in property, and between inequalities arising from  inherited wealth and from acquired wealth. Inequality resulting from differences    135     in personal capacities, or from differences in wealth accumulated by the  individual in question, are considered appropriate, or at least not so clearly  inappropriate as differences resulting from inherited wealth.   This distinction is untenable. Is there any greater ethical justification for  the high returns to the individual who inherits from his parents a peculiar voice  for which there is a great demand than for the high returns to the individual who  inherits property? The sons of Russian commissars surely have a higher  expectation of income perhaps also of liquidation than the sons of peasants. Is  this any more or less justifiable than the higher income expectation of the son of  an American millionaire? We can look at this same question in another way. A  parent who has wealth that he wishes to pass on to his child can do so in  different ways. He can use a given sum of money to finance his child's training  as, say, a certified public accountant, or to set him up in business, or to set up a  trust fund yielding him a property income. In any of these cases, the child will  have a higher income than he otherwise would. But in the first case, his income  will be regarded as coming from human capacities; in the second, from profits;  in the third, from inherited wealth. Is there any basis for distinguishing among  these categories of receipts on ethical grounds? Finally, it seems illogical to say  that a man is entitled to what he has produced by personal capacities or to the  produce of the wealth he has accumulated, but that he is not entitled to pass  any wealth on to his children; to say that a man may use his income for riotous  living but may not give it to his heirs. Surely, the latter is one way to use what  he has produced.   The fact that these arguments against the so-called capitalist ethic are  invalid docs not of course demonstrate that the capitalist ethic is an acceptable  one. I find it difficult to justify either accepting or rejecting it, or to justify any  alternative principle.   I am led to the view that it cannot in and of itself be regarded as an  ethical principle; that it must be regarded as instrumental or a corollary of some  other principle such as freedom.   Some hypothetical examples may illustrate the fundamental difficulty.  Suppose there are four Robinson Crusoes, independently marooned on four  islands in the same neighborhood. One happened to land on a large and fruitful  island which enables him to live easily and well. The others happened to land on  tiny and rather barren islands from which they can barely scratch a living. One  day, they discover the existence of one another. Of course, it would be generous  of the Crusoe on the large island if he invited the others to join him and share its  wealth. But suppose he does not. Would the other three be justified in joining  forces and compelling him to share his wealth with them? Many a reader will be  tempted to say yes. But before yielding to this temptation, consider precisely the    136     same situation in different guise. Suppose you and three friends are walking  along the street and you happen to spy and retrieve a $ 20 bill on the pavement.  It would be generous of you, of course, if you were to divide it equally with  them, or at least blow them to a drink. But suppose you do not. Would the other  three be justified in joining forces and compelling you to share the $ 20 equally  with them? I suspect most readers will be tempted to say no. And on further  reflection, they may even conclude that the generous course of action is not  itself clearly the ""right"" one. Are we prepared to urge on ourselves or our fellows  that any person whose wealth exceeds the average of all persons in the world  should immediately dispose of the excess by distributing it equally to all the rest  of the world's inhabitants ? We may admire and praise such action when  undertaken by a few. But a universal ""potlatch"" would make a civilized world  impossible.   In any event, two wrongs do not make a right. The unwillingness of the  rich Robinson Crusoe or the lucky finder of the $ 20 bill to share his wealth does  not justify the use of coercion by the others. Can we justify being judges in our  own case, deciding on our own when we are entitled to use force to extract what  we regard as our due from others? Or what we regard as not their due? Most  differences of status or position or wealth can be regarded as the product of  chance at a far enough remove. The man who is hard working and thrifty is to  be regarded as ""deserving""; yet these qualities owe much to the genes he was  fortunate (or unfortunate?) enough to inherit.   Despite the lip service that we all pay to ""merit"" as compared to ""chance,""  we are generally much readier to accept inequalities arising from chance than  those clearly attributable to merit. The college professor whose colleague wins a  sweepstake will envy him but is unlikely to bear him any malice or to feel  unjustly treated. Let the colleague receive a trivial raise that makes his salary  higher than the professor's own, and the professor is far more likely to feel  aggrieved. After all, the goddess of chance, as of justice, is blind. The salary  raise was a deliberate judgment of relative merit.   The Instrumental Role of Distribution According to Product   The operative function of payment in accordance with product in a market  society is not primarily distributive, but allocative. As was pointed out in chapter  i, the central principle of a market economy is co-operation through voluntary  exchange. Individuals co-operate with others because they can in this way  satisfy their own wants more effectively. But unless an individual receives the  whole of what he adds to the product, he will enter into exchanges on the basis  of what he can receive rather than what he can produce. Exchanges will not take  place that would have been mutually beneficial if each party received what he  contributed to the aggregate product. Payment in accordance with product is    137     therefore necessary in order that resources be used most effectively, at least  under a system depending on voluntary co-operation. Given sufficient  knowledge, it might be that compulsion could be substituted for the incentive of  reward, though I doubt that it could. One can shuffle inanimate objects around;  one can compel individuals to be at certain places at certain times; but one can  hardly compel individuals to put forward their best efforts. Put another way, the  substitution of compulsion for co-operation changes the amount of resources  available.   Though the essential function of payment in accordance with product in a  market society is to enable resources to be allocated efficiently without  compulsion, it is unlikely to be tolerated unless it is also regarded as yielding  distributive justice. No society can be stable unless there is a basic core of value  judgments that are unthinkingly accepted by the great bulk of its members.  Some key institutions must be accepted as ""absolutes,"" not simply as  instrumental. I believe that payment in accordance with product has been, and,  in large measure, still is, one of these accepted value judgments or institutions.   One can demonstrate this by examining the grounds on which the internal  opponents of the capitalist system have attacked the distribution of income  resulting from it. It is a distinguishing feature of the core of central values of a  society that it is accepted alike by its members, whether they regard themselves  as proponents or as opponents of the system of organization of the society. Even  the severest internal critics of capitalism have implicitly accepted payment in  accordance with product as ethically fair.   The most far-reaching criticism has come from the Marxists. Marx argued  that labor was exploited. Why? Because labor produced the whole of the product  but got only part of it; the rest is Marx's ""surplus value."" Even if the statements  of fact implicit in this assertion were accepted, the value judgment follows only if  one accepts the capitalist ethic. Labor is ""exploited"" only if labor is entitled to  what it produces. If one accepts instead the socialist premise, ""to each according  to his need, from each according to his ability"" whatever that may mean it is  necessary to compare what labor produces, not with what it gets but with its  ""ability"", and to compare what labor gets, not with what it produces but with its  ""need.""    Of course, the Marxist argument is invalid on other grounds as well. There  is, first, the confusion between the total product of all co-operating resources  and the amount added to productin the economist's jargon, marginal product.  Even more striking, there is an unstated change in the meaning of ""labor"" in  passing from the premise to the conclusion. Marx recognized the role of capital in  producing the product but regarded capital as embodied labor. Hence, written  out in full, the premises of the Marxist syllogism would run: ""Present and past    138     labor produce the whole of the product. Present labor gets only part of the  product."" The logical conclusion is presumably ""Past labor is exploited,"" and the  inference for action is that past labor should get more of the product, though it is  by no means clear how, unless it be in elegant tombstones.   The achievement of allocation of resources without compulsion is the  major instrumental role in the market place of distribution in accordance with  product. But it is not the only instrumental role of the resulting inequality. We  have noted in chapter i the role that inequality plays in providing independent  foci of power to offset the centralization of political power, as well as the role  that it plays in promoting civil freedom by providing ""patrons"" to finance the  dissemination of unpopular or simply novel ideas. In addition, in the economic  sphere, it provides ""patrons"" to finance experimentation and the development of  new products to buy the first experimental automobiles and television sets, let  alone impressionist paintings. Finally, it enables distribution to occur impersonally  without the need for ""authority"" a special facet of the general role of the market  in effecting co-operation and co-ordination without coercion.   Facts of Income Distribution   A capitalist s
stem involving payment in accordance with product can be,  and in practice is, characterized by considerable inequality of income and wealth.  This fact is frequently misinterpreted to mean that capitalism and free enterprise  produce wider inequality than alternative systems and, as a corollary, that the  extension and development of capitalism has meant increased inequality. This  misinterpretation is fostered by the misleading character of most published  figures on the distribution of income, in particular their failure to distinguish  shortrun from long-run inequality. Let us look at some of the broader facts about  the distribution of income.   One of the most striking facts which runs counter to many people's  expectation has to do with the sources of income. The more capitalistic a country  is, the smaller the fraction of income paid for the use of what is generally  regarded as capital, and the larger the fraction paid for human services. In  underdeveloped countries like India, Egypt, and so on, something like half of  total income is property income. In the United States, roughly one-fifth is  property income. And in other advanced capitalist countries, the proportion is not  very different. Of course, these countries have much more capital than the  primitive countries but they are even richer in the productive capacity of their  residents; hence, the larger income from property is a smaller fraction of the  total. The great achievement of capitalism has not been the accumulation of  property, it has been the opportunities it has offered to men and women to  extend and develop and improve their capacities. Yet the enemies of capitalism    139     are fond of castigating it as materialist, and its friends all too often apologize for  capitalism's materialism as a necessary cost of progress.   Another striking fact, contrary to popular conception, is that capitalism  leads to less inequality than alternative systems of organization and that the  development of capitalism has greatly lessened the extent of inequality.  Comparisons over space and time alike confirm this view. There is surely  drastically less inequality in Western capitalist societies like the Scandinavian  countries, France, Britain, and the United States, than in a status society like  India or a backward country like Egypt. Comparison with communist countries  like Russia is more difficult because of paucity and unreliability of evidence. But if  inequality is measured by differences in levels of living between the privileged  and other classes, such inequality may well be decidedly less in capitalist than in  communist countries. Among the Western countries alone, inequality appears to  be less, in any meaningful sense, the more highly capitalist the country is: less in  Britain than in France, less in the United States than in Britain though these  comparisons are rendered difficult by the problem of allowing for the intrinsic  heterogeneity of populations; for a fair comparison, for example, one should  perhaps compare the United States, not with the United Kingdom alone but with  the United Kingdom plus the West Indies plus its African possessions.   With respect to changes over time, the economic progress achieved in the  capitalist societies has been accompanied by a drastic diminution in inequality. As  late as 1848, John Stuart Mill could write, ""Hitherto [1848] it is questionable if all  the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of any human  being. They have enabled a greater population to live the same life of drudgery  and imprisonment, and an increased number of manufacturers and others to  make fortunes. They have increased the comforts of the middle classes. But they  have not yet begun to effect those great changes in human destiny, which it is in  their nature and in their futurity to accomplish."" 1 This statement was probably  not correct even for Mill's day, but certainly no one could write this today about  the advanced capitalist countries. It is still true about the rest of the world.   The chief characteristic of progress and development over the past  century is that it has freed the masses from backbreaking toil and has made  available to them products and services that were formerly the monopoly of the  upper classes, without in any corresponding way expanding the products and  services available to the wealthy. Medicine aside, the advances in technology  have for the most part simply made available to the masses of the people  luxuries that were always available in one form or another to the truly wealthy.  Modern plumbing, central heating, automobiles, television, radio, to cite just a  few examples, provide conveniences to the masses equivalent to those that the  wealthy could always get by the use of servants, entertainers, and so on.    140     Detailed statistical evidence on these phenomena, in the form of  meaningful and comparable distributions of income, is hard to come by, though  such studies as have been made confirm the broad conclusions just outlined.  Such statistical data, however, can be extremely misleading. They cannot  segregate differences in income that are equalizing from those that are not. For  example, the short working life of a baseball player means that the annual  income during his active years must be much higher than in alternative pursuits  open to him to make it equally attractive financially. But such a difference affects  the figures in exactly the same way as any other difference in income. The  income unit for which the figures are given is also of great importance. A  distribution for individual income recipients always shows very much greater  apparent inequality than a distribution for family units: many of the individuals  are housewives working part-time or receiving a small amount of property  income, or other family members in a similar position. Is the distribution that is  relevant for families one in which the families are classified by total family  income? Or by income per person? Or per equivalent unit? This is no mere  quibble. I believe that the changing distribution of families by number of children  is the most important single factor that has reduced inequality of levels of living  in this country during the past half century. It has been far more important than  graduated inheritance and income taxes. The really low levels of living were the  joint product of relatively low family incomes and relatively large numbers of  children. The average number of children has declined and, even more  important, this decline has been accompanied and largely produced by a virtual  elimination of the very large family. As a result, families now tend to differ much  less with respect to number of children. Yet this change would not be reflected in  a distribution of families by the size of total family income.   A major problem in interpreting evidence on the distribution of income is  the need to distinguish two basically different kinds of inequality; temporary,  short-run differences in income, and differences in long-run income status.  Consider two societies that have the same distribution of annual income. In one  there is great mobility and change so that the position of particular families in  the income hierarchy varies widely from year to year. In the other, there is great  rigidity so that each family stays in the same position year after year. Clearly, in  any meaningful sense, the second would be the more unequal society. The one  kind of inequality is a sign of dynamic change, social mobility, equality of  opportunity; the other, of a status society. The confusion of these two kinds of  inequality is particularly important, precisely because competitive free-enterprise  capitalism tends to substitute the one for the other. Non-capitalist societies tend  to have wider inequality than capitalist, even as measured by annual income; in  addition, inequality in them tends to be permanent, whereas capitalism  undermines status and introduces social mobility.    141     Government Measures Used to alter the Distribution of Income   The methods that governments have used most widely to alter the  distribution of income have been graduated income and inheritance taxation.  Before considering their desirability, it is worth asking whether they have  succeeded in their aim.   No conclusive answer can be given to this question with our present  knowledge. The judgment that follows is a personal, though I hope not utterly  uninformed, opinion, stated, for sake of brevity, more dogmatically than the  nature of the evidence justifies. My impression is that these tax measures have  had a relatively minor, though not negligible, effect in the direction of narrowing  the differences between the average position of groups of families classified by  some statistical measures of income. However, they have also introduced  essentially arbitrary inequalities of comparable magnitude between persons  within such income classes. As a result, it is by no means clear whether the net  effect in terms of the basic objective of equality of treatment or equality of  outcome has been to increase or decrease equality.   The tax rates are on paper both high and highly graduated. But their  effect has been dissipated in two different ways. First, part of their effect has  been simply to make the pre-tax distribution more unequal. This is the usual  incidence effect of taxation. By discouraging entry into activities highly taxedin  this case activities with large risk and non-pecuniary disadvantagesthey raise  returns in those activities. Second, they have stimulated both legislative and  other provisions to evade the taxso-called ""loopholes"" in the law such as  percentage depletion, exemption of interest on state and municipal bonds,  specially favorable treatment of capital gains, expense accounts, other indirect  ways of payment, conversion of ordinary income to capital gains, and so on in  bewildering number and kind. The effect has been to make the actual rates  imposed far lower than the nominal rates and, perhaps more important, to make  the incidence of the taxes capricious and unequal. People at the same economic  level pay very different taxes depending on the accident of the source of their  income and the opportunities they have to evade the tax. If present rates were  made fully effective, the effect on incentives and the like might well be so  serious as to cause a radical loss in the productivity of the society. Tax avoidance  may therefore have been essential for economic wellbeing. If so, the gain has  been bought at the cost of a great waste of resources, and of the introduction of  widespread inequity. A much lower set of nominal rates, plus a more  comprehensive base through more equal taxation of all sources of income could  be both more progressive in average incidence, more equitable in detail, and less  wasteful of resources.    142     This judgment that the personal income tax has been arbitrary in its  impact and of limited effectiveness in reducing inequality is widely shared by  students of the subject, including many who strongly favor the use of graduated  taxation to reduce inequality. They too urge that the top bracket rates be  drastically reduced and the base broadened.   A further factor that has reduced the impact of the graduated tax  structure on inequality of income and wealth is that these taxes are much less  taxes on being wealthy than on becoming wealthy. While they limit the use of  the income from existing wealth, they impede even more strikingly so far as they  are effective the accumulation of wealth. The taxation of the income from the  wealth does nothing to reduce the wealth itself, it simply reduces the level of  consumption and additions to wealth that the owners can support. The tax  measures give an incentive to avoid risk and to embody existing wealth in  relatively stable forms, which reduces the likelihood that existing accumulations  of wealth will be dissipated. On the other side, the major route to new  accumulations is through large current incomes of which a large fraction is saved  and invested in risky activities, some of which will yield high returns. If the  income tax were effective, it would close this route. In consequence, its effect  would be to protect existing holders of wealth from the competition of  newcomers. In practice, this effect is largely dissipated by the avoidance devices  already referred to. It is notable how large a fraction of the new accumuations  have been in oil, where the percentage depletion allowances provide a  particularly easy route to the receipt of tax-free income.   In judging the desirability of graduated income taxation it seems to me  important to distinguish two problems, even though the distinction cannot be  precise in application: first, the raising of funds to finance the expenses of those  governmental activities it is decided to undertake (including perhaps measures to  eliminate poverty discussed in chapter xii); second, the imposition of taxes for  redistributive purposes alone. The former might well call for some measure of  graduation, both on grounds of assessing costs in accordance with benefits and  on grounds of social standards of equity. But the present high nominal rates on  top brackets of income and inheritance can hardly be justified on this ground if  only because their yield is so low.   I find it hard, as a liberal, to see any justification for graduated taxation  solely to redistribute income. This seems a clear case of using coercion to take  from some in order to give to others and thus to conflict head-on with individual  freedom.   All things considered, the personal income tax structure that seems to me  best is a flat-rate tax on income above an exemption, with income defined very  broadly and deductions allowed only for strictly defined expenses of earning    143     income. As already suggested in chapter v, I would combine this program with  the abolition of the corporate income tax, and with the requirement that  corporations be required to attribute their income to stockholders, and that  stockholders be required to include such sums on their tax returns. The most  important other desirable changes are the elimination of percentage depletion on  oil and other raw materials, the elimination of tax exemption of interest on state  and local securities, the elimination of special treatment of capital gains, the co-  ordination of income, estate, and gift taxes, and the elimination of numerous  deductions now allowed.   An exemption, it seems to me, can be a justified degree of graduation  (see further discussion in chapter xii). It is very different for 90 per cent of the  population to vote taxes on themselves and an exemption for 10 per cent than  for 90 per cent to vote punitive taxes on the other 10 percent which is in effect  what has been done in the United States. A proportional flat-rate-tax would  involve higher absolute payments by persons with higher incomes for  governmental services, which is not clearly inappropriate on grounds of benefits  conferred. Yet it would avoid a situation where any large numbers could vote to  impose on others taxes that did not also affect their own tax burden.   The proposal to substitute a flat-rate income tax for the present  graduated rate structure will strike many a reader as a radical proposal. And so it  is in terms of concept. For this very reason, it cannot be too strongly emphasized  that it is not radical in terms of revenue yield, redistribution of income, or any  other relevant criterion. Our present income tax rates range from 20 per cent to  91 per cent, with the rate reaching 50 per cent on the excess of taxable incomes  over $ 18,000 for single taxpayers or $ 36,000 for married taxpayers filing joint  returns. Yet a flat rate of 23 1/2 per cent on taxable income as presently  reported and presently defined, that is, above present exemptions and after all  presently allowable deductions, would yield as much revenue as the present  highly graduated rate. 2 In fact, such a flat rate, even with no change whatsoever  in other features of the law, would yield a higher revenue because a larger  amount of taxable income 
ould be reported for three reasons: there would be  less incentive than now to adopt legal but costly schemes that reduce the  amount of taxable income reported (so-called tax avoidance); there would be  less incentive to fail to report income that legally should be reported (tax  evasion); the removal of the disincentive effects of the present structure of rates  would produce a more efficient use of present resources and a higher income.   If the yield of the present highly graduated rates is so low, so also must  be their redistributive effects. This does not mean that they do no harm. On the  contrary. The yield is so low partly because some of the most competent men in  the country devote their energies to devising ways to keep it so low; and  because many other men shape their activities with one eye on tax effects. All    144     this is sheer waste. And what do we get for it? At most, a feeling of satisfaction  on the part of some that the state is redistributing income. And even this feeling  is founded on ignorance of the actual effects of the graduated tax structure, and  would surely evaporate if the facts were known.   To return to the distribution of income, there is a clear justification for  social action of a very different kind than taxation to affect the distribution of  income. Much of the actual inequality derives from imperfections of the market.  Many of these have themselves been created by government action or could be  removed by government action. There is every reason to adjust the rules of the  game so as to eliminate these sources of inequality. For example, special  monopoly privileges granted by government, tariffs, and other legal enactments  benefiting particular groups, are a source of inequality. The removal of these, the  liberal will welcome. The extension and widening of educational opportunities  has been a major factor tending to reduce inequalities. Measures such as these  have the operational virtue that they strike at the sources of inequality rather  than simply alleviating the symptoms.   The distribution of income is still another area in which government has  been doing more harm by one set of measures than it has been able to undo by  others. It is another example of the justification of government intervention in  terms of alleged defects of the private enterprise system when many of the  phenomena of which champions of big government complain are themselves the  creation of government, big and small.",Capitalism and Freedom  The Distribution of Income,"Friedman examines the progressive income tax, introduced in order to redistribute income to make things more fair, and finds that, in fact, the rich take advantage of numerous loopholes, nullifying the redistributive effects. It would be far more effective just to have a uniform flat tax with no deductions, which could meet the 1962 tax revenues with a rate only slightly greater than the lowest tax bracket at that time."
"The humanitarian and egalitarian sentiment which helped produce the  steeply graduated individual income tax has also produced a host of other  measures directed at promoting the ""welfare"" of particular groups. The most  important single set of measures is the bundle misleadingly labeled ""social  security."" Others are public housing, minimum wage laws, farm price supports,  medical care for particular groups, special aid programs, and so on.   I shall first discuss briefly a few of the latter, mostly to indicate how  different their actual effects may be from those intended, and shall then discuss  at somewhat greater length the largest single component of the social security  program, old age and survivor's insurance.   Miscellaneous Welfare Measures   I. Public Housing One argument frequently made for public housing is  based on an alleged neighborhood effect: slum districts in particular, and other  low quality housing to a lesser degree, are said to impose higher costs on the  community in the form of fire and police protection. This literal neighborhood  effect may well exist. But insofar as it does, it alone argues, not for public  housing, but for higher taxes on the kind of housing that adds to social costs  since this would tend to equalize private and social cost.   It will be answered at once that the extra taxes would bear on low-income  people and that this is undesirable. The answer means that public housing is   proposed not on the ground of neighborhood effects but as a means of helping   low-income people. If this be the case, why subsidize housing in particular? If  funds are to be used to help the poor, would they not be used more effectively  by being given in cash rather than in kind? Surely, the families being helped  would rather have"" a given sum in cash than in the form of housing. They could  themselves spend the money on housing if they so desired. Hence, they would  never be worse off if given cash; if they regarded other needs as more  important, they would be better off. The cash subsidy would solve the   neighborhood effect as well as the subsidy in kind, since if it were not used to  buy housing it would be available to pay extra taxes justified by the   neighborhood effect.   Public housing cannot therefore be justified on the grounds either of  neighborhood effects or of helping poor families. It can be justified, if at all, only  on grounds of paternalism; that the families being helped ""need"" housing more  than they ""need"" other things but would themselves either not agree or would    146     spend the money unwisely. The liberal will be inclined to reject this argument for  responsible adults. He cannot completely reject it in the more indirect form in  which it affects children; namely, that parents will neglect the welfare of the  children, who ""need"" the better housing. But he will surely demand evidence  much more persuasive and to the point than the kind usually given before he can  accept this final argument as adequate justification for large expenditures on  public housing.   So much could have been said in the abstract, in advance of actual  experience with public housing. Now that we have had experience, we can go  much farther. In practice, public housing has turned out to have effects very  different indeed from those intended.   Far from improving the housing of the poor, as its proponents expected,  public housing has done just the reverse. The number of dwelling units  destroyed in the course of erecting public housing projects has been far larger  than the number of new dwelling units constructed. But public housing as such  has done nothing to reduce the number of persons to be housed. The effect of  public housing has therefore been to raise the number of persons per dwelling  unit. Some families have probably been better housed than they would otherwise  have been those who were fortunate enough to get occupancy of the publicly  built units. But this has only made the problem for the rest all the worse, since  the average density of all together went up.   Of course, private enterprise offset some of the deleterious effect of the  public housing program by conversion of existing quarters and construction of  new ones for either the persons directly displaced or, more generally, the  persons displaced at one or two removes in the game of musical chairs set in  motion by the public housing projects. However, these private resources would  have been available in the absence of the public housing program.   Why did the public housing program have this effect? For the general  reason we have stressed time and again. The general interest that motivated  many to favor instituting the program is diffuse and transitory. Once the program  was adopted, it was bound to be dominated by the special interests that it could  serve. In this case, the special interests were those local groups that were  anxious to have blighted areas cleared and refurbished, either because they  owned property there or because the blight was threatening local or central  business districts. Public housing served as a convenient means to accomplish  their objective, which required more destruction than construction.   Even so, ""urban blight"" is still with us in undiminished force, to judge by  the growing pressure for federal funds to deal with it.    147     Another gain its proponents expected from public housing was the  reduction of juvenile delinquency by improving housing conditions. Here again,  the program in many instances had precisely the opposite effect, entirely aside  from its failure to improve average housing conditions. The income limitations  quite properly imposed for the occupancy of public housing at subsidized rentals  have led to a very high density of ""broken"" families in particular, divorced or  widowed mothers with children. Children of broken families are especially likely  to be ""problem"" children and a high concentration of such children is likely to  increase juvenile delinquency. One manifestation has been the very adverse  effect on schools in the neighborhood of a public housing project. Whereas a  school can readily absorb a few ""problem"" children it is very difficult for it to  absorb a large number. Yet in some cases, broken families are a third or more of  the total in a public housing project and the project may account for a majority  of the children in the school. Had these families been assisted through cash  grants, they would have been spread much more thinly through the community.   2. Minimum wage laws Minimum wage laws are about as clear a case as  one can find of a measure the effects of which are precisely the opposite of  those intended by the men of good will who support it. Many proponents of  minimum wage laws quite properly deplore extremely low rates; they regard  them as a sign of poverty; and they hope, by outlawing wage rates below some  specified level, to reduce poverty. In fact, insofar as minimum wage laws have  any effect at all, their effect is clearly to increase poverty. The state can legislate  a minimum wage rate. It can hardly require employers to hire at that minimum  all who were formerly employed at wages below the minimum. It is clearly not in  the interest of employers to do so. The effect of the minimum wage is therefore  to make unemployment higher than it otherwise would be. Insofar as the low  wage rates are in fact a sign of poverty, the people who are rendered  unemployed are precisely those who can least afford to give up the income they  had been receiving, small as it may appear to the people voting for the minimum  wage.    This case is in one respect very much like public housing. In both, the  people who are helped are visible the people whose wages are raised; the  people who occupy the publicly built units. The people who are hurt are  anonymous and their problem is not clearly connected to its cause: the people  who join the ranks of the unemployed or, more likely, are never employed in  particular activities because of the existence of the minimum wage and are  driven to even less remunerative activities or to the relief rolls; the people who  are pressed ever closer together in the spreading slums that seem to be rather a  sign of the need for more public housing than a consequence of the existing  public housing.    148     A large part of the support for minimum wage laws comes not from  disinterested men of good will but from interested parties. For example, northern  trade unions and northern firms threatened by southern competition favor  minimum wage laws to reduce the competition from the South.   3. Farm price supports Farm price supports are another example. Insofar  as they can be justified at all on grounds other than the political fact that rural  areas are over-represented in the electoral college and Congress, it must be on  the belief that farmers on the average have low incomes. Even if this be  accepted as a fact, farm price supports do not accomplish the intended purpose  of helping the farmers who need help. In the first place, benefits arc, if anything,  inverse to need, since they are in proportion to the amount sold on the market.  The impecunious farmer not only sells less on the market than the wealthier  farmer; in addition, he gets a larger fraction of his income from products grown  for his own use, and these do not qualify for the benefits. In the second place,  the benefits, if any, to farmers from the price-support program are much smaller  than the total amount spent. This is clearly true of the amount spent for storage  and similar costs which does not go to the farmer at all indeed the suppliers of  storage capacity and facilities may well be the major beneficiaries. It is equally  true of the amount spent to purchase agricultural products. The farmer is  thereby induced to spend additional sums on fertilizer, seed, machinery, etc. At  most, only the excess adds to his income. And finally, even this residual of a  residual overstates the gain since the effect of the program has been to keep  more people on the farm than would otherwise have stayed there. Only the  excess, if any, of what they can earn on the farm with the price-support program  over what they can earn off the farm, is a net benefit to them. The main effect  of the purchase program has simply been to make farm output larger, not to  raise the income per farmer.   Some of the costs of the farm purchase program are so obvious and well-  known as to need little more than mention: the consumer has paid twice, once in  taxes for farm benefit payments, again by paying a higher price for food; the  farmer has been saddled with onerous restrictions and detailed centralized  control; the nation has been saddled with a spreading bureaucracy. There is,  however, one set of costs which is less well known. The farm program has been  a major hindrance in the pursuit of foreign policy. In order to maintain a higher  domestic than world price, it has been necessary to impose quotas on imports  for many items. Erratic changes in our policy have had serious adverse effects on  other countries. A high price for cotton encouraged other countries to enlarge  their cotton production. When our high price led to an unwieldy stock of cotton,  we proceeded to sell overseas at low prices and imposed heavy losses on the  producers whom we had by our earlier actions encouraged to expand output.  The list of similar cases could be multiplied.    149     Old Age and Survivor's Insurance   The ""social security"" program is one of those things on which the tyranny  of the status quo is beginning to work its magic. Despite the controversy that  surrounded its inception, it has come to be so much taken for granted that its  desirability is hardly questioned any longer. Yet it involves a large-scale invasion  into the personal lives of a large fraction of the nation without, so far as I can  see, any justification that is at all persuasive, not only on liberal principles, but  on almost any other. I propose to examine the biggest phase of it, that which  involves payments to the aged.   As an operational matter, the program known as old age and survivor's  insurance (OASI) consists of a special tax imposed on payrolls, plus payments to  persons who have reached a specified age, of amounts determined by the age at  which payments begin, family status, and prior earning record.   As an analytical matter, OASI consists of three separable elements:   1. The requirement that a wide class of persons must purchase specified  annuities, i.e., compulsory provision for old age.   2. The requirement that the annuity must be purchased from the  government; i.e., nationalization of the provision of these annuities.   3. A scheme for redistributing income, insofar as the value of the  annuities to which people are entitled when they enter the system is not equal to  the taxes they will pay.   Clearly, there is no necessity for these elements to be combined. Each  individual could be required to pay for his own annuity; the individual could be  permitted to purchase an annuity from private firms; yet individuals could be  required to purchase specified annuities. The government could go into the  business of selling annuities without compelling individuals to buy specified  annuities and require the business to be self-supporting. And clearly the  government can and does engage in redistribution without using the device of  annuities.   Let us therefore consider each of these elements in turn to see how far, if  at all, each can be justified. It will facilitate our analysis, I believe, if we consider  them in reverse order.   1. Income redistribution. The present OASI program involves two major  kinds of redistribution; from some OASI beneficiaries to others; from the general  taxpayer to OASI beneficiaries.    150     The first kind of redistribution is primarily from those who entered the  system relatively young, to those who entered it at an advanced age. The latter  are receiving, and will for some time be receiving, a greater amount as benefits  than the taxes they paid could have purchased. Under present tax and benefit  schedules, on the other hand, those who entered the system at a young age will  receive decidedly less.   I do not see any grounds liberal or other on which this particular  redistribution can be defended. The subsidy to the beneficiaries is independent  of their poverty or wealth; the man of means receives it as much as the indigent.  The tax which pays the subsidy is a flat-rate tax on earnings up to a maximum.  It constitutes a larger fraction of low incomes than of high. What conceivable  justification is there for taxing the young to subsidize the old regardless of the  economic status of the old; for imposing a higher rate of tax for this purpose on  the low incomes than on the high; or, for that matter, for raising the revenues to  pay the subsidy by a tax on payrolls?   The second kind of redistribution arises because the system is not likely to  be fully self-financing. During the period when many were covered and paying  taxes, and few had qualified for benefits, the system appeared to be self-  financing and indeed to be having a surplus. But this appearance depends on  neglecting the obligation being accumulated with respect to the persons paying  the tax. It is doubtful that the taxes paid have sufficed to finance the  accumulated obligation. Many experts assert that even on a cash basis, a subsidy  will be required. And such a subsidy generally has been required in similar  systems in other countries. This is a highly technical matter which we cannot and  need not go into here and about which there can be honest differences of  opinion.   For our purpose, it is enough to ask only the hypothetical question  whether a subsidy from the general taxpayer could be justified if it is required. I  see no grounds on which such a subsidy can be justified. We may wish to help  poor people. Is there any justification for helping people whether they are poor  or not because they happen to be a certain age? Is this not an entirely arbitrary  redistribution?   The only argument I have ever come across to justify the redistribution  involved in OASI is one that I regard as t
oroughly immoral despite its wide use.  This argument is that OASI redistribution on the average helps low-income  people more than high-income people despite a large arbitrary element; that it  would be better to do this redistribution more efficiently; but that the community  will not vote for the redistribution directly though it will vote for it as part of a  social security package. In essence, what this argument says is that the    151     community can be fooled into voting for a measure that it opposes by presenting  the measure in a false guise. Needless to say, the people who argue this way are  the loudest in their condemnation of ""misleading"" commercial advertising! 1   2. Nationalization of the provision of required annuities Suppose we avoid  redistribution by requiring each person to pay for the annuity he gets, in the  sense of course, that the premium suffices to cover the present value of the  annuity, account being taken both of mortality and interest returns. What  justification is there then for requiring him to purchase it from a governmental  concern? If redistribution is to be accomplished, clearly the taxing power of the  government must be used. But if redistribution is to be no part of the program  and, as we have just seen, it is hard to see any justification for making it part,  why not permit individuals who wish to do so to purchase their annuities from  private concerns? A close analogy is provided by state laws requiring compulsory  purchase of automobile liability insurance. So far as I know, no state which has  such a law even has a state insurance company, let alone compels automobile  owners to buy their insurance from a government agency.   Possible economies of scale are no argument for nationalizing the  provision of annuities. If they are present, and the government sets up a concern  to sell annuity contracts, it may be able to undersell competitors by virtue of its  size. In that case, it will get the business without compulsion. If it cannot  undersell them, then presumably economics of scale are not present or are not  sufficient to overcome other diseconomies of governmental operation.   One possible advantage of nationalizing the provision of annuities is to  facilitate the enforcement of compulsory purchase of annuities. However, this  seems a rather trivial advantage. It would be easy to devise alternative  administrative arrangements, such as requiring individuals to include a copy of a  receipt for premium payments along with their income tax returns; or having  their employers certify to their having met the requirement. The administrative  problem would surely be minor compared with that imposed by the present  arrangements.   The costs of nationalization seem clearly to outweigh any such trivial  advantage. Here, as elsewhere, individual freedom to choose, and competition of  private enterprises for custom, would promote improvements in the kinds of  contracts available, and foster variety and diversity to meet individual need. On  the political level, there is the obvious gain from avoiding an expansion in the  scale of governmental activity and the indirect threat to freedom of every such  expansion.   Some less obvious political costs arise from the character of the present  program. The issues involved become very technical and complex. The layman is    152     often incompetent to judge them. Nationalization means that the bulk of the  ""experts"" become employees of the nationalized system, or university people  closely linked with it. Inevitably, they come to favor its expansion, not, I hasten  to add, out of narrow self-interest but because they are operating within a  framework in which they take for granted governmental administration and are  familiar only with its techniques. The only saving grace in the United States so  far has been the existence of private insurance companies involved in similar  activities.   Effective control by Congress over the operations of such agencies as the  Social Security Administration becomes essentially impossible as a result of the  technical character of their task and their near-monopoly of experts. They  become self-governing bodies whose proposals are in the main rubber-stamped  by Congress. The able and ambitious men who make their careers in them are  naturally anxious to expand the scope of their agencies and it is exceedingly  difficult to prevent them from doing so. If the expert says yea, who is there  competent to say nay? So we have seen an increasing fraction of the population  drawn into the social security system, and now that there remain few possibilities  of expansion in that direction, we are seeing a move toward the addition of new  programs, such as medical care.   I conclude that the case against the nationalization of the provision of  annuities is exceedingly strong, not only in terms of liberal principles but even in  terms of the values expressed by proponents of the welfare state. If they believe  that the government can provide the service better than the market, they should  favor a government concern to issue annuities in open competition with other  concerns. If they are right, the government concern will prosper. If they are  wrong, the welfare of the people will be advanced by having a private  alternative. Only the doctrinaire socialist, or the believer in centralized control for  its own sake, can, so far as I can see, take a stand on principle in favor of  nationalization of the provision of annuities.   3. Compulsory Purchase of Annuities Having cleared away the underbrush,  we are now ready to face the key issue: compelling individuals to use some of  their current income to purchase annuities to provide for their old age.   One possible justification for such compulsion is strictly paternalistic.  People could if they wished decide to do individually what the law requires them  to do as a group. But they are separately short-sighted and improvident. ""We""  know better than ""they"" that it is in their own good to provide for their old age to  a greater extent than they would voluntarily; we cannot persuade them  individually; but we can persuade 51 per cent or more to compel all to do what is  in their own good. This paternalism is for responsible people, hence docs not  even have the excuse of concern for children or madmen.    153     This position is internally consistent and logical. A thoroughgoing  paternalist who holds it cannot be dissuaded by being shown that he is making a  mistake in logic. He is our opponent on grounds of principle, not simply a well-  meaning but misguided friend. Basically, he believes in dictatorship, benevolent  and maybe majoritarian, but dictatorship none the less.   Those of us who believe in freedom must believe also in the freedom of  individuals to make their own mistakes. If a man knowingly prefers to live for  today, to use his resources for current enjoyment, deliberately choosing a  penurious old age, by what right do we prevent him from doing so? We may  argue with him, seek to persuade him that he is wrong, but are we entitled to  use coercion to prevent him from doing what he chooses to do? Is there not  always the possibility that he is right and that we are wrong? Humility is the  distinguishing virtue of the believer in freedom; arrogance, of the paternalist.   Few people are thoroughgoing paternalists. It is a position that is most  unattractive if examined in the cold light of the day. Yet the paternalistic  argument has played so large a role in measures like social security that it seems  worth making it explicit.   A possible justification on liberal principles for compulsory purchase of  annuities is that the improvident will not suffer the consequence of their own  action but will impose costs on others. We shall not, it is said, be willing to see  the indigent aged suffer in dire poverty. We shall assist them by private and  public charity. Hence the man who does not provide for his old age will become  a public charge. Compelling him to buy an annuity is justified not for his own  good but for the good of the rest of us.   The weight of this argument clearly depends on fact. If 90 per cent of the  population would become charges on the public at age 65 in the absence of  compulsory purchase of annuities, the argument would have great weight. If  only 1 per cent would, the argument has none. Why restrict the freedom of 99  per cent to avoid the costs that the other 1 per cent would impose on the  community?   The belief that a large fraction of the community would become public  charges if not compelled to purchase annuities owed its plausibility, at the time  OASI was enacted, to the Great Depression. In every year from 1931 through  1940, more than one-seventh of the labor force was unemployed. And  unemployment was proportionately heavier among the older workers. This  experience was unprecedented and has not been repeated since. It did not arise  because people were improvident and failed to provide for their old age. It was a  consequence, as we have seen, of government mismanagement. OASI is a cure,    154     if cure it be at all, for a very different malady and one of which we have had no  experience.   The unemployed of the 1930's certainly created a serious problem of the  relief of distress, of many people becoming public charges. But old-age was by  no means the most serious problem. Many people in productive ages were on  the relief or assistance rolls. And the steady spread of OASI, until today more  than sixteen million persons receive benefits, has not prevented a continued  growth in the number receiving public assistance.   Private arrangements for the care of the aged have altered greatly over  time. Children were at one time the major means whereby people provided for  their own old age. As the community became more affluent, the mores changed.  The responsibilities imposed on children to care for their parents declined and  more and more people came to make provision for old age in the form of  accumulating property or acquiring private pension rights. More recently, the  development of pension plans over and above OASI has accelerated. Indeed,  some students believe that a continuation of present trends points to a society in  which a large fraction of the public scrimps in their productive years to provide  themselves with a higher standard of life in old age than they ever enjoyed in  the prime of life. Some of us may think such a trend perverse, but if it reflects  the tastes of the community, so be it.   Compulsory purchase of annuities has therefore imposed large costs for  little gain. It has deprived all of us of control over a sizable fraction of our  income, requiring us to devote it to a particular purpose, purchase of a  retirement annuity, in a particular way, by buying it from a government concern.  It has inhibited competition in the sale of annuities and the development of  retirement arrangements. It has given birth to a large bureaucracy that shows  tendencies of growing by what it feeds on, of extending its scope from one area  of our life to another. And all this, to avoid the danger that a few people might  become charges on the public.",Capitalism and Freedom  Social Welfare Measures,"Though well-intentioned, many social welfare measures don't help the poor as much as some think. Friedman focuses on Social Security as a particularly large and unfair system."
"The extraordinary economic growth experienced by Western countries  during the past two centuries and the wide distribution of the benefits of free  enterprise have enormously reduced the extent of poverty in any absolute sense  in the capitalistic countries of the West. But poverty is in part a relative matter,  and even in these countries, there are clearly many people living under  conditions that the rest of us label as poverty.   One recourse, and in many ways the most desirable, is private charity. It  is noteworthy that the heyday of laissez-faire, the middle and late nineteenth  century in Britain and the United States, saw an extraordinary proliferation of  private eleemosynary organizations and institutions. One of the major costs of  the extension of governmental welfare activities has been the corresponding  decline in private charitable activities.   It can be argued that private charity is insufficient because the benefits  from it accrue to people other than those who make the giftsagain, a  neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by  its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its  alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me.  To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of  poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the  same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can  suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal  communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much  more difficult for it to do so.   Suppose one accepts, as I do, this line of reasoning as justifying  governmental action to alleviate poverty; to set, as it were, a floor under the  standard of life of every person in the community. There remain the questions,  how much and how. I see no way of deciding ""how much"" except in terms of the  amount of taxes weby which I mean the great bulk of usare willing to impose on  ourselves for the purpose. The question, ""how,"" affords more room for  speculation.   Two things seem clear. First, if the objective is to alleviate poverty, we  should have a program directed at helping the poor. There is every reason to  help the poor man who happens to be a farmer, not because he is a farmer but  because he is poor. The program, that is, should be designed to help people as  people not as members of particular occupational groups or age groups or wage-  rate groups or labor organizations or industries. This is a defect of farm  programs, general old-age benefits, minimum-wage laws, pro-union legislation,    157     tariffs, licensing provisions of crafts or professions, and so on in seemingly  endless profusion. Second, so far as possible the program should, while  operating through the market, not distort the market or impede its functioning.  This is a defect of price supports, minimum-wage laws, tariffs and the like.   The arrangement that recommends itself on purely mechanical grounds is  a negative income tax. We now have an exemption of $ 600 per person under  the federal income tax (plus a minimum 10 per cent flat deduction). If an  individual receives $ 100 taxable income, i.e., an income of $ 100 in excess of  the exemption and deductions, he pays a tax. Under the proposal, if his taxable  income minus $ 100, i.e., $ 100 less than the exemption plus deductions, he  would pay a negative tax, i.e., receive a subsidy. If the rate of subsidy were, say,  50 per cent, he would receive $ 50. If he had no income at all, and, for  simplicity, no deductions, and the rate were constant, he would receive $ 300.  He might receive more than this if he had deductions, for example, for medical  expenses, so that his income less deductions, was negative even before  subtracting the exemption. The rates of subsidy could, of course, be graduated  just as the rates of tax above the exemption are. In this way, it would be  possible to set a floor below which no man's net income (defined now to include  the subsidy) could fallin the simple example $ 300 per person. The precise floor  set would depend on what the community could afford.   The advantages of this arrangement are clear. It is directed specifically at  the problem of poverty. It gives help in the form most useful to the individual,  namely, cash. It is general and could be substituted for the host of special  measures now in effect. It makes explicit the cost borne by society. It operates  outside the market. Like any other measures to alleviate poverty, it reduces the  incentives of those helped to help themselves, but it does not eliminate that  incentive entirely, as a system of supplementing incomes up to some fixed  minimum would. An extra dollar earned always means more money available for  expenditure.   No doubt there would be problems of administration, but these seem to  me a minor disadvantage, if they be a disadvantage at all. The system would fit  directly into our current income tax system and could be administered along with  it. The present tax system covers the bulk of income recipients and the necessity  of covering all would have the by-product of improving the operation of the  present income tax. More important, if enacted as a substitute for the present  rag bag of measures directed at the same end, the total administrative burden  would surely be reduced.   A few brief calculations suggest also that this proposal could be far less  costly in money, let alone in the degree of governmental intervention involved,  than our present collection of welfare measures. Alternatively, these calculations    158     can be regarded as showing how wasteful our present measures are, judged as  measures for helping the poor.   In 1961, government amounted to something like $ 33 billion (federal,  state, and local) on direct welfare payments and programs of all kinds: old age  assistance, social security benefit payments, aid to dependent children, general  assistance, farm price support programs, public housing, etc.l I have excluded  veterans' benefits in making this calculation. I have also made no allowance for  the direct and indirect costs of such measures as minimum-wage laws, tariffs,  licensing provisions, and so on, or for the costs of public health activities, state  and local expenditures on hospitals, mental institutions, and the like.   There are approximately 57 million consumer units (unattached individuals  and families) in the United States. The 1961 expenditures of $ 33 billion would  have financed outright cash grants of nearly $ 6,000 per consumer unit to the 10  per cent with the lowest incomes. Such grants would have raised their incomes  above the average for all units in the United States. Alternatively, these  expenditures would have financed grants of nearly $ 3,000 per consumer unit to  the 20 per cent with the lowest incomes. Even if one went so far as that one-  third whom New Dealers were fond of calling ill-fed, ill-housed, and illclothed,  1961 expenditures would have financed grants of nearly $ 2,000 per consumer  unit, roughly the sum which, after allowing for the change in the level of prices,  was the income which separated the lower one-third in the middle 1930's from  the upper two-thirds. Today, fewer than one-eighth of consumer units have an  income, adjusted for the change in the level of prices, as low as that of the  lowest third in the middle 1930's.   Clearly, these are all far more extravagant programs than can be justified  to ""alleviate poverty"" even by a rather generous interpretation of that term. A  program which supplemented the incomes of the 20 per cent of the consumer  units with the lowest incomes so as to raise them to the lowest income of the  rest would cost less than half of what we are now spending.   The major disadvantage of the proposed negative income tax is its  political implications. It establishes a system under which taxes are imposed on  some to pay subsidies to others. And presumably, these others have a vote.  There is always the danger that instead of being an arrangement under which  the great majority tax themselves willingly to help an unfortunate minority, it will  be converted into one under which a majority imposes taxes for its own benefit  on an unwilling minority. Because this proposal makes the process so explicit,  the danger is perhaps greater than with other measures. I see no solution to this  problem except to rely on the self-restraint and good will of the electorate.    159     Writing about a corresponding problem British old-age pensions in 1914,  Dicey said, ""Surely a sensible and a benevolent man may well ask himself  whether England as a whole will gain by enacting that the receipt of poor relief,  in the shape of a pension, shall be consistent with the pensioner's retaining the  right to join in the election of a Member of Parliament."" 2   The verdict of experience in Britain on Dicey's question must as yet be  regarded as mixed. England did move to universal suffrage without the  disfranchisement of either pensioners or other recipients of state aid. And there  has been an enormous expansion of taxation of some for the benefit of others,  which must surely be regarded as having retarded Britain's growth, and so may  not even have benefited most of those who regard themselves as on the  receiving end. But these measures have not destroyed, at least as yet, Britain's  liberties or its predominantly capitalistic system. And, more important, there have  been some signs of a turning of the tide and of the exercise of self-restraint on  the part of the electorate.   Liberalism and Egalitamanism   The heart of the liberal philosophy is a belief in the dignity of the  individual, in his freedom to make the most of his capacities and opportunities  according to his own lights, subject only to the proviso that he not interfere with  the freedom of other individuals to do the same. This implies a belief in the  equality of men in one sense; in their inequality in another. Each man has an  equal right to freedom. This is an important and fundamental right precisely  because men are different, because one man will want to do different things with  his freedom than another, and in the process can contribute more than another  to the general culture of the society in which many men live.   The liberal will therefore distinguish sharply between equality of rights and  equality of opportunity, on the one hand, and material equality or equality of  outcome on the other. He may welcome the fact that a free society in fact tends  toward greater material equality than any other yet tried. But he will regard this  as a desirable by-product of a free society, not its major justification. He will  welcome measures that promote both freedom and equalitysuch as measures to  eliminate monopoly power and to improve the operation of the market. He will  regard private charity directed at helping the less fortunate as an example of the  proper use of freedom. And he may approve state action toward ameliorating  poverty as a more effective way in which the great bulk of the community can  achieve a common objective. He will do so with regret, however, at having to  substitute compulsory for voluntary action.   The egalitarian will go this far, too. But he will want to go further. He will  defend taking from some to give to others, not as a more effective means    160     whereby the ""some"" can achieve an objective they want to achieve, but on  grounds of ""justice."" At this point, equality comes sharply into conflict with  freedom; one must choose. One cannot be both an egalitarian, in this sense, and  a liberal.",Capitalism and Freedom  Allieviation of Poverty,"He advocates a negative income tax to fix the issue, giving everyone a guaranteed minimum income, rather than current measures, which he sees as misguided and inefficient."
"In the 1920's and the 1930's, intellectuals in the United States were  overwhelmingly persuaded that capitalism was a defective system inhibiting  economic well-being and thereby freedom, and that the hope for the future lay  in a greater measure of deliberate control by political authorities over economic  affairs. The conversion of the intellectuals was not achieved by the example of  any actual collectivist society, though it undoubtedly was much hastened by the  establishment of a communist society in Russia and the glowing hopes placed in  it. The conversion of the intellectuals was achieved by a comparison between the  existing state of affairs, with all its injustices and defects, and a hypothetical  state of affairs as it might be. The actual was compared with the ideal.   At the time, not much else was possible. True, mankind had experienced  many epochs of centralized control, of detailed intervention by the state into  economic affairs. But there had been a revolution in politics, in science, and in  technology. Surely, it was argued, we can do far better with a democratic  political structure, modern tools, and modern science than was possible in earlier  ages.    The attitudes of that time are still with us. There is still a tendency to  regard any existing government intervention as desirable, to attribute all evils to  the market, and to evaluate new proposals for government control in their ideal  form, as they might work if run by able, disinterested men, free from the  pressure of special interest groups. The proponents of limited government and  free enterprise are still on the defensive.   Yet, conditions have changed. We now have several decades of  experience with governmental intervention. It is no longer necessary to compare  the market as it actually operates and government intervention as it ideally might  operate. We can compare the actual with the actual.   If we do so, it is clear that the difference between the actual operation of  the market and its ideal operation great though it undoubtedly is is as nothing  compared to the difference between the actual effects of government  intervention and their intended effects. Who can now see any great hope for the  advancement of men's freedom and dignity in the massive tyranny and  despotism that hold sway in Russia? Wrote Marx and Engels in The Communist  Manifesto: ""The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a  world to win."" Who today can regard the chains of the proletarians in the Soviet  Union as weaker than the chains of the proletarians in the United States, or  Britain or France or Germany or any Western state?    162     Let us look closer to home. Which if any of the great ""reforms"" of past  decades has achieved its objectives? Have the good intentions of the proponents  of these reforms been realized?   Regulation of the railroads to protect the consumer quickly became an  instrument whereby the railroads could protect themselves from the competition  of newly emerging rivals at the expense, of course, of the consumer.   An income tax initially enacted at low rates and later seized upon as a  means to redistribute income in favor of the lower classes has become a facade,  covering loopholes and special provisions that render rates that arc highly  graduated on paper largely ineffective. A flat rate of 23 1/2 per cent on presently  taxable income would yield as much revenue as the present rates graduated  from 20 to 91 per cent. An income tax intended to reduce inequality and  promote the diffusion of wealth has in practice fostered reinvestment of  corporate earnings, thereby favoring the growth of large corporations, inhibiting  the operation of the capital market, and discouraging the establishment of new  enterprises.   Monetary reforms, intended to promote stability in economic activity and  prices, exacerbated inflation during and after World War I and fostered a higher  degree of instability thereafter than had ever been experienced before. The  monetary authorities they established bear primary responsibility for converting a  serious economic contraction into the catastrophe of the Great Depresson from  192933. A system established largely to prevent bank panics produced the most  severe banking panic in American history.   An agricultural program intended to help impecunious farmers and to  remove what were alleged to be basic dislocations in the organization of  agriculture has become a national scandal that has wasted public funds,  distorted the use of resources, riveted increasingly heavy and detailed controls  on farmers, interfered seriously with United States foreign policy, and withal has  done little to help the impecunious farmer.   A housing program intended to improve the housing conditions of the  poor, to reduce juvenile delinquency, and to contribute to the removal of urban  slums, has worsened the housing conditions of the poor, contributed to juvenile  delinquency, and spread urban blight.   In the 1930's, ""labor"" was synonomous with ""labor union"" to the  intellectual community; faith in the purity and virtue of labor unions was on a par  with faith in home and motherhood. Extensive legislation was enacted to favor  labor unions and to foster ""fair"" labor relation. Labor unions waxed in strength.  By the 1950's, ""labor union"" was almost a dirty word; it as no longer    163     synonomous with ""labor,"" no longer automatically to be taken for granted as on  the side of the angels.   Social security measures were enacted to make receipt of assistance a  matter of right, to eliminate the need for direct relief and assistance. Millions  now receive social security benefits. Yet the relief rolls grow and the sums spent  on direct assistance mount.   The list can easily be lengthened: the silver purchase program of the  1930's, public power projects, foreign aid programs of the post-war years,  F.C.C., urban redevelopment programs, the stockpiling program these and many  more have had effects very different and generally quite opposite from those  intended.   There have been some exceptions. The expressways crisscrossing the  country, magnificent dams spanning great rivers, orbiting satellites are all  tributes to the capacity of government to command great resources. The school  system, with all its defects and problems, with all the possibility of improvement  through bringing into more effective play the forces of the market, has widened  the opportunities available to American youth and contributed to the extension of  freedom. It is a testament to the public-spirited efforts of the many tens of  thousands who have served on local school boards and to the willingness of the  public to bear heavy taxes for what they regarded as a public purpose. The  Sherman antitrust laws, with all their problems of detailed administration, have  by their very existence fostered competition. Public health measures have  contributed to the reduction of infectious disease. Assistance measures have  relieved suffering and distress. Local authorities have often provided facilities  essential to the life of communities. Law and order have been maintained,  though in many a large city the performance of even this elementary function of  government has been far from satisfactory. As a citizen of Chicago, I speak  feelingly.   If a balance be struck, there can be little doubt that the record is dismal.  The greater part of the new ventures undertaken by government in the past few  decades have failed to achieve their objectives. The United States has continued  to progress; its citizens have become better fed, better clothed, better housed,  and better transported; class and social distinctions have narrowed; minority  groups have become less disadvantaged; popular culture has advanced by leaps  and bounds. All this has been the product of the initiative and drive of individuals  co-operating through the free market. Government measures have hampered not  helped this development. We have been able to afford and surmount these  measures only because of the extraordinary fecundity of the market. The  invisible hand has been more potent for progress than the visible hand for  retrogression.    164     Is it an accident that so many of the governmental reforms of recent  decades have gone awry, that the bright hopes have turned to ashes? Is it  simply because the programs are faulty in detail?   I believe the answer is clearly in the negative. The central defect of these  measures is that they seek through government to force people to act against  their own immediate interests in order to promote a supposedly general interest.  They seek to resolve what is supposedly a conflict of interest, or a difference in  view about interests, not by establishing a framework that will eliminate the  conflict, or by persuading people to have different interests, but by forcing  people to act against their own interest. They substitute the values of outsiders  for the values of participants; either some telling others what is good for them,  or the government taking from some to benefit others. These measures are  therefore countered by one of the strongest and most creative forces known to  man the attempt by millions of individuals to promote their own interests, to live  their lives by their own values. This is the major reason why the measures have  so often had the opposite of the effects intended. It is also one of the major  strengths of a free society and explains why governmental regulation docs not  strangle it.   The interests of which I speak are not simply narrow self-regarding  interests. On the contrary, they include the whole range of values that men hold  dear and for which they are willing to spend their fortunes and sacrifice their  lives. The Germans who lost their lives opposing Adolph Hitler were pursuing  their interests as they saw them. So also are the men and women who devote  great effort and time to charitable, educational, and religious activities. Naturally,  such interests are the major ones for few men. It is the virtue of a free society  that it nonetheless permits these interests full scope and does not subordinate  them to the narrow materialistic interests that dominate the bulk of mankind.  That is why capitalist societies are less materialistic than collectivist societies.   Why is it, in light of the record, that the burden of proof still seems to rest  on those of us who oppose new government programs and who seek to reduce  the already unduly large role of government? Let Dicey answer: ""The beneficial  effect of State intervention, especially in the form of legislation, is direct,  immediate, and, so to speak, visible, whilst its evil effects are gradual and  indirect, and lie out of sight. . . . Nor. . . do most people keep in mind that State  inspectors may be incompetent, careless, or even occasionally corrupt . . . ; few  are those who realize the undeniable truth that State help kills self-help. Hence  the majority of mankind must almost of necessity look with undue favor upon  governmental intervention. This natural bias can be counteracted only by the  existence, in a given society, ... of a presumption or prejudice in favor of  individual liberty, that is, of laissez-faire. The mere decline, therefore, of faith in    165     self-help and that such a decline has taken place is certain is of itself sufficient to  account for the growth of legislation tending towards socialism."" 1   The preservation and expansion of freedom are today threatened from  two directions. The one threat is obvious and clear. It is the external threat  coming from the evil men in the Kremlin who promise to bury us. The other  threat is far more subtle. It is the internal threat coming from men of good  intentions and good will who wish to reform us. Impatient with the slowness of  persuasion and example to achieve the great social changes they envision, they  are anxious to use the power of the state to achieve their ends and confident of  their own ability to do so. Yet if they gained the power, they would fail to  achieve their immediate aims and, in addition, would produce a collective state  from which they would recoil in horror and of which they would be among the  first victims. Concentrated power is not rendered harmless by the good  intentions of those who create it.   The two threats unfortunately reinforce one another. Even if we avoid a  nuclear holocaust, the threat from the Kremlin requires us to devote a sizable  fraction of our resources to our military defense. The importance of government  as a buyer of so much of our output, and the sole buyer of the output of many  firms and industries, already concentrates a dangerous amount of economic  power in the hands of the political authorities, changes the environment in which  business operates and the criteria relevant for business success, and in these  and other ways endangers a free market. This danger we cannot avoid. But we  needlessly intensify it by continuing the present widespread governmental  intervention in areas unrelated to the military defense of the nation and by  undertaking ever new governmental programs from medical care for the aged to  lunar exploration.   As Adam Smith once said, ""There is much ruin in a nation"". Our basic  structure of values and the interwoven network of free institutions will withstand  much. I believe that we shall be able to preserve and extend freedom despite  the size of the military programs and despite the economic powers already  concentrated in Washington. But we shall be able to do so only if we awake to  the threat that we face, only if we persuade our fellow men that free institutions  offer a surer, if perhaps at times a slower, route to the ends they seek than the  coercive power of the state. The glimmerings of change that are already  apparent in the intellectual climate are a hopeful augury.",Capitalism and Freedom  Conclusion,"The conclusion to the book centers on how, time and time again, government intervention often has an effect opposite of that intended. Most good things in the United States and the world come from the free market, not the government, and they will continue to do so. The government, despite its good intentions, should stay out of areas where it does not need to be."
"When people first hear the term crucial conversation, many conjure up images of presidents, emperors, and prime ministers seated around a massive table while they debate the future. Although its true that such discussions have a wide-sweeping impact, theyre not the kind we have in mind. The crucial conversations were referring to are interactions that happen to everyone. Theyre the day-to-day conversations that affect your life. Now, what makes one of your conversations crucial as opposed to plain vanilla? First, opinions vary . For example, youre talking with your boss about a possible promotion. She thinks youre not ready; you think you are. Second, stakes are high . Youre in a meeting with four coworkers and youre trying to pick a new marketing strategy. Youve got to do something different or your company isnt going to hit its annual goals. Third, emotions run strong . Youre in the middle of a casual discussion with your spouse and he or she brings up an ugly incident that took place at yesterdays neighborhood block party. Apparently not only did you flirt with someone at the party, but according to your spouse, You were practically making out. You dont remember flirting. You simply remember being polite and friendly. Your spouse walks off in a huff. And speaking of the block party, at one point youre making small talk with your somewhat crotchety and always colorful neighbor about his shrinking kidneys when he says, Speaking of the new fence youre building . . . From that moment on you end up in a heated debate over placing the new fencethree inches one way or the other. Three inches! He finishes by threatening you with a lawsuit, and you punctuate your points by mentioning that hes not completely aware of the difference between his hind part and his elbow. Emotions run really strong. What makes each of these conversations crucialand not simply challenging, frustrating, frightening, or annoyingis that the results could have a huge impact on the quality of your life. In each case, some element of your daily routine could be forever altered for better or worse. Clearly a promotion could make a big difference. Your companys success affects you and everyone you work with. Your relationship with your spouse influences every aspect of your life. Even something as trivial as a debate over a property line affects how you get along with your neighbor. Despite the importance of crucial conversations, we often back away from them because we fear well make matters worse. Weve become masters at avoiding tough conversations. Coworkers send e-mail to each other when they should walk down the hall and talk turkey. Bosses leave voice mail in lieu of meeting with their direct reports. Family members change the subject when an issue gets too risky. We (the authors) have a friend who learned through a voice-mail message that his wife was divorcing him. We use all kinds of tactics to dodge touchy issues. HOW DO WE TYPICALLY HANDLE CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS? Just because were in the middle of a crucial conversation (or maybe thinking about stepping up to one) doesnt mean that were in trouble or that we wont fare well. In truth, when we face crucial conversations, we can do one of three things:  We can avoid them.  We can face them and handle them poorly. We can face them and handle them well. That seems simple enough. Walk away from crucial conversations and suffer the consequences. Handle them poorly and suffer the consequences. Or handle them well. I dont know, you think to yourself. Given the three choices, Ill go with handling them well. When It Matters Most, We Do Our Worst But do we handle them well? When talking turns tough, do we pause, take a deep breath, announce to our innerselves, Uh-oh, this discussion is crucial. Id better pay close attention and then trot out our best behavior? Or when were anticipating a potentially dangerous discussion, do we step up to it rather than scamper away? Sometimes. Sometimes we boldly step up to hot topics, monitor our behavior, and offer up our best work. We mind our Ps and Qs. Sometimes were just flat-out good . And then we have the rest of our lives. These are the moments when, for whatever reason, were at our absolute worstwe yell; we withdraw; we say things we later regret. When conversations matter the mostthat is, when conversations move from casual to crucialwere generally on our worst behavior. Why is that? Were designed wrong . When conversations turn from routine to crucial, were often in trouble. Thats because emotions dont exactly prepare us to converse effectively. Countless generations of genetic shaping drive humans to handle crucial conversations with flying fists and fleet feet, not intelligent persuasion and gentle attentiveness. For instance, consider a typical crucial conversation. Someone says something you disagree with about a topic that matters a great deal to you and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. The hairs you can handle. Unfortunately, your body does more. Two tiny organs seated neatly atop your kidneys pump adrenaline into your bloodstream. You dont choose to do this. Your adrenal glands do it, and then you have to live with it. And thats not all. Your brain then diverts blood from activities it deems nonessential to high-priority tasks such as hitting and running. Unfortunately, as the large muscles of the arms and legs get more blood, the higher-level reasoning sections of your brain get less . As a result, you end up facing challenging conversations with the same intellectual equipment available to a rhesus monkey. Your body is preparing to deal with an attacking saber-toothed tiger, not your boss, neighbor, or loved ones. Were under pressure . Lets add another factor. Crucial conversations are frequently spontaneous. More often than not, they come out of nowhere. And since youre caught by surprise, youre forced to conduct an extraordinarily complex human interaction in real timeno books, no coaches, and certainly no short breaks while a team of therapists runs to your aid and pumps you full of nifty ideas. What do you have to work with? The issue at hand, the other person, and a brain thats drunk on adrenaline and almost incapable of rational thought. Its little wonder that we often say and do things that make perfect sense in the moment, but later on seem, well, stupid. What was I thinking? you wonderwhen what you should be asking is: What part of my brain was I thinking with? The truth is, you were real-time multitasking with a brain that was working another job. Youre lucky you didnt suffer a stroke. Were stumped . Now lets throw in one more complication. You dont know where to start. Youre making this up as you go along because you havent often seen real-life models of effective communication skills. Lets say that you actually planned for a tough conversationmaybe youve even mentally rehearsed. You feel prepared, and youre as cool as a cucumber. Will you succeed? Not necessarily. You can still screw up, because practice doesnt make perfect; perfect practice makes perfect. This means that first you have to know what to practice. Sometimes you dont. After all, you may have never actually seen how a certain problem is best handled. You may have seen what not to doas modeled by a host of friends, colleagues, and, yes, even your parents. In fact, you may have sworn time and again not to act the same way. Left with no healthy models, youre now more or less stumped. So what do you do? You do what most people do. You wing it. You piece together the words, create a certain mood, and otherwise make up what you think will workall the while multiprocessing with a half-starved brain. Its little wonder that when it matters the most, were often at our worst behavior. We act in self-defeating ways . In our doped-up, dumbed-down state, the strategies we choose for dealing with our crucial conversations are perfectly designed to keep us from what we actually want. Were our own worst enemiesand we dont even realize it. Heres how this works. Lets say that your significant other has been paying less and less attention to you. You realize he or she has a busy job, but you still would like more time together. You drop a few hints about the issue, but your loved one doesnt handle it well. You decide not to put on added pressure, so you clam up. Of course, since youre not all that happy with the arrangement, your displeasure now comes out through an occasional sarcastic remark. Another late night, huh? Ive got Facebook friends I see more often. Unfortunately (and heres where the problem becomes self-defeating), the more you snip and snap, the less your loved one wants to be around you. So your significant other spends even less time with you, you become even more upset, and the spiral continues. Your behavior is now actually creating the very thing you didnt want in the first place. Youre caught in an unhealthy, self-defeating loop. Or consider whats happening with your roommate Terrywho wears your and your other two roommates clothes (without asking)and hes proud of it. In fact, one day while walking out the door, he glibly announced that he was wearing something from each of your closets. You could see Taylors pants, Scotts shirt, and, yes, even Chriss new matching shoes-and-socks ensemble. What of yours could he possibly be wearing? Eww! Your response, quite naturally, has been to bad-mouth Terry behind his back. That is, until one day when he overheard you belittling him to a friend, and youre now so embarrassed that you avoid being around him. Now when youre out of the apartment, he wears your clothes, eats your food, and uses your computer out of spite. Lets try another example. You share a cubicle with a four-star slob and youre a bit of a neat freak. Your coworker has left you notes written in grease pencil on your file cabinet, in catsup on the back of a french-fry bag, and in permanent marker on your desk blotter. You, in contrast, leave him printed Post-it notes. Printed . At first you sort of tolerated each other. Then you began to get on each others nerves. You started nagging him about cleaning up. He started nagging you about your nagging. Now youre beginning to react to each other. Every time you nag, he becomes upset, and, well, lets say that he doesnt exactly clean up. Every time he calls you an anal-retentive nanny, you vow not to give in to his vile and filthy ways. What has come from all this bickering? Now youre neater than ever, and your cubicle partners half of the work area is about to be condemned by the health department. Youre caught in a self-defeating loop. The more the two of you push each other, the more you create the very behaviors you both despise. Some Common Crucial ConversationsIn each of these examples of unhealthy downward spirals, the stakes were moderate to high, opinions varied, and emotions ran strong. Actually, to be honest, in a couple of the examples the stakes were fairly low at first, but with time and growing emotions, the relationship eventually turned sour and quality of life sufferedmaking the risks high. These examples, of course, are merely the tip of an enormous and ugly iceberg of problems stemming from crucial conversations that either have been avoided or have gone wrong. Other topics that could easily lead to disaster include  Ending a relationship  Talking to a coworker who behaves offensively or makes suggestive comments  Asking a friend to repay a loan  Giving the boss feedback about her behavior  Approaching a boss who is breaking his own safety or quality policies  Critiquing a colleagues work  Asking a roommate to move out  Resolving custody or visitation issues with an ex-spouse  Dealing with a rebellious teen  Talking to a team member who isnt keeping commitments  Discussing problems with sexual intimacy  Confronting a loved one about a substance abuse problem  Talking to a colleague who is hoarding information or resources  Giving an unfavorable performance review  Asking in-laws to quit interfering Talking to a coworker about a personal hygiene problem OUR AUDACIOUS CLAIM Lets say that either you avoid tough issues, or when you do bring them up, youre on your worst behavior. How high are the stakes? This is just talk, right? Do the consequences of a fouled-up conversation extend beyond the conversation itself? Should you worry? Actually, the effects of conversations gone bad can be both devastating and far reaching. Our research has shown that strong relationships, careers, organizations, and communities all draw from the same source of powerthe ability to talk openly about high-stakes, emotional, controversial topics. So heres the audacious claim: The Law of Crucial Conversations At the heart of almost all chronic problems in our organizations, our teams, and our relationships lie crucial conversationsones that were either not holding or not holding well. Twenty years of research involving more than 100,000 people reveals that the key skill of effective leaders, teammates, parents, and loved ones is the capacity to skillfully address emotionally and politically risky issues. Period. Here are just a few examples of these fascinating findings. Kick-Start Your Career Could the ability to master crucial conversations help your career? Absolutely. Twenty-five years of research in seventeen different organizations has taught us that individuals who are the most influentialwho can get things done and at the same time build on relationshipsare those who master their crucial conversations. For instance, high performers know how to stand up to the boss without committing career suicide. Weve all seen people hurt their careers by ineffectively discussing tough issues. You may have done it yourself. Fed up with a lengthy and unhealthy pattern of behavior, you finally speak out but a bit too abruptly. Oops. Or maybe an issue becomes so hot that as your peers twitch and fidget themselves into a quivering mass of potential stroke victims, you decide to say something. Its not a pretty discussionbut somebody has to have the guts to keep the boss from doing something stupid. (Gulp.) As it turns out, you dont have to choose between being honest and being effective. You dont have to choose between candor and your career. People who routinely hold crucial conversations and hold them well are able to express controversial and even risky opinions in a way that gets heard. Their bosses, peers, and direct reports listen without becoming defensive or angry. What about your career? Are there crucial conversations that youre not holding or not holding well? Is this undermining your influence? And more importantly, would your career take a step forward if you could improve how youre dealing with these conversations? Improve Your Organization Is it possible that an organizations performance could hang on something as soft and gushy as how individuals deal with crucial conversations? Study after study suggests that the answer is yes . We began our work twenty-five years ago looking for what we called crucial moments . We wondered, Are there a handful of moments when someones actions disproportionately affect key performance indicators? And if so, what are those moments and how should we act when they occur? It was that search that led us to crucial conversations. We found that more often than not, the world changes when people have to deal with a very risky issue and either do it poorly or do it well. For example: Silence kills . A doctor is getting ready to insert a central IV line into a patient but fails to put on the proper gloves, gown, and mask to ensure the procedure is done as safely as possible. After the nurse reminds the doctor of the proper protections, the doctor ignores her comment and beginsthe insertion. In a study of over 7,000 doctors and nurses, weve found caregivers face this crucial moment all the time. In fact, 84 percent of respondents said that they regularly see people taking shortcuts, exhibiting incompetence, or breaking rules. And thats not the problem! The real problem is that those who observe deviations or infractions say nothing . Across the world weve found that the od
s of a nurse speaking up in this crucial moment are less than one in twelve. The odds of doctors stepping up to similar crucial conversations arent much better. And when they dont speak up, when they dont hold an effective crucial conversation, it impacts patient safety (some even die), nursing turnover, physician satisfaction, nursing productivity, and a host of other results. Silence fails . When it comes to the corporate world, the most common complaint of executives and managers is that their people work in silos. They do great at tasks that are handled entirely within their team. Unfortunately, close to 80 percent of the projects that require cross-functional cooperation cost far more than expected, produce less than hoped for, and run significantly over budget . We wondered why. So we studied over 2,200 projects and programs that had been rolled out at hundreds of organizations worldwide. The findings were stunning. You can predict with nearly 90 percent accuracy which projects will failmonths or years in advance. And now back to our premise. The predictor of success or failure was whether people could hold five specific crucial conversations. For example, could they speak up if they thought the scope and schedule were unrealistic? Or did they go silent when a cross-functional team member began sloughing off? Or even more trickywhat should they do when an executive failed to provide leadership for the effort? In most organizations, employees fell silent when these crucial moments hit. Fortunately, in those organizations where people were able to candidly and effectively speak up about these concerns, the projects were less than half as likely to fail. Once again, the presenting problems showed up in key performance indicators such as spiraling costs, late delivery times, and low morale. Nevertheless, the underlying cause was the unwillingness or inability to speak up at crucial moments. Other important studies weve conducted (read the complete studies at www.vitalsmarts.com/research have shown that companies with employees who are skilled at crucial conversations:  Respond five times faster to financial downturnsand make budget adjustments far more intelligently than less-skilled peers (Research Study: Financial Agility) .  Are two-thirds more likely to avoid injury and death due to unsafe conditions (Research Study: Silent Danger) .  Save over $1,500 and an eight-hour workday for every crucial conversation employees hold rather than avoid (Research Study: The Costs of Conflict Avoidance) .  Substantially increase trust and reduce transaction costs in virtual work teams. Those who cant handle their crucial conversations suffer in thirteen different ways (backstabbing, gossip, undermining, passive aggression, etc.) as much as three times more often in virtual teams than in colocated teams (Research Study: Long-Distance Loathing) .  Influence change in colleagues who are bullying, conniving, dishonest, or incompetent. When over 4,000 respondents were asked, 93 percent of them said that, in their organization, people like this are almost untouchablestaying in their position four years or longer without being held accountable (Research Study: Corporate Untouchables) . Most leaders get it wrong. They think that organizational productivity and performance are simply about policies, processes, structures, or systems. So when their software product doesnt ship on time, they benchmark others development processes . Or when productivity flags, they tweak their performance management system . When teams arent cooperating, they restructure . Our research shows that these types of nonhuman changes fail more often than they succeed. Thats because the real problem never was in the process, system, or structureit was in employee behavior . The key to real change lies not in implementing a new process, but in getting people to hold one another accountable to the process. And that requires Crucial Conversations skills. In the worst companies, poor performers are first ignored and then transferred. In good companies, bosses eventually deal with problems. In the best companies, everyone holds everyone else accountableregardless of level or position. The path to high productivity passes not through a static system, but through face-to-face conversations. So what about you? Is your organization stuck in its progress toward some important goal? If so, are there conversations that youre either avoiding or botching? And how about the people you work with? Are they stepping up to or walking away from crucial conversations? Could you take a big step forward by improving how you deal with these conversations? Improve Your Relationships Consider the impact crucial conversations can have on your relationships. Could failed crucial conversations lead to failed relationships? As it turns out, when you ask the average person what causes couples to break up, he or she usually suggests that its due to differences of opinion. You know, people have different theories about how to manage their finances, spice up their love lives, or rear their children. In truth, everyone argues about important issues. But not everyone splits up. Its how you argue that matters. For example, when our colleague, Howard Markman, examined couples in the throes of heated discussions, he learned that people fall into three categoriesthose who digress into threats and name-calling, those who revert to silent fuming, and those who speak openly, honestly, and effectively. After observing couples for hundreds of hours, the two scholars predicted relationship outcomes and tracked their research subjects relationships for the next decade. Remarkably, they were able to predict nearly 90 percent of the divorces that occurred. 1 But more important, they found that helping couples learn to hold crucial conversations more effectively reduced the chance of unhappiness or breakup by more than half! Now, what about you? Think of your own important relationships. Are there a few crucial conversations that youre currently avoiding or handlingpoorly? Do you walk away from some issues only to come charging back into others? Do you hold in ugly opinions only to have them tumble out as sarcastic remarks or cheap shots? How about your significant other or family members? Are they constantly toggling from seething silence to subtle but costly attacks? When it matters the most (after all, these are your cherished loved ones), are you on your worst behavior? If so, you definitely have something to gain by learning more about how to handle crucial conversations. Improve Your Personal Health If the evidence so far isnt compelling enough to focus your attention on crucial conversations, what would you say if we told you that the ability to master high-stakes discussions is a key to a healthier and longer life? Immune systems . Consider the groundbreaking research done by Dr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser and Dr. Ronald Glaser. They studied the immune systems of couples who had been married an average of forty-two years by comparing those who argued constantly with those who resolved their differences effectively. It turns out that arguing for decades doesnt lessen the destructive blow of constant conflict. Quite the contrary. Those who routinely failed their crucial conversations had far weaker immune systems than those who found a way to resolve them well. 2 Of course, the weaker their immune system, the worse their health. Life-threatening diseases . In perhaps the most revealing of all the health-related studies, a group of subjects who had contracted malignant melanoma received traditional treatment and then were divided into two groups. One group met weekly for only six weeks; the other did not. Facilitators taught the first group of recovering patients specific communication skills. (When its your life thats at stake, could anything be more crucial?) After meeting only six times and then dispersing for five years, the subjects who learned how to express themselves effectively had a higher survival rateonly 9 percent succumbed as opposed to almost 30 percent in the untrained group. 3 Think about the implications of this study. Just a modest improvement in the ability to talk and connect with others corresponded to a two-thirds decrease in the death rate. We could go on for pages about how the ability to hold crucial conversations has an impact on your personal health. The evidence is mounting every day. Nevertheless, most people find this claim a bit over the top. Come on, they chide. Youre saying that the way you talk or dont talk affects your body? It could kill you? The short answer is yes. The longer answer suggests that the negative feelings we hold in, the emotional pain we suffer, and the constant battering we endure as we stumble our way through unhealthy conversations slowly eat away at our health. In some cases the impact of failed conversations leads to minor problems. In others it results in disaster. In all cases, failed conversations never make us happier, healthier, or better off. So how about you? What are the specific conversations that gnaw at you the most? Which conversations (if you held them or improved them) would strengthen your immune system, help ward off disease, and increase your quality of life and well-being? SUMMARY When stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions start to run strong, casual conversations transform into crucial ones. Ironically, the more crucial the conversation, the less likely we are to handle it well. The consequences of either avoiding or fouling up crucial conversations can be severe. When we fail a crucial conversation, every aspect of our lives can be affectedfrom our careers, to our communities, to our relationships, to our personal health. And now for the good news. As we learn how to step up to crucial conversationsand handle them wellwith one set of high-leverage skills we can influence virtually every domain of our lives. What is this all-important skill set? What do people who sail through crucial conversations actually do? More important, can we do it too?",Crucial Conversations - Whats a Crucial Conversation? And Who Cares?,"A crucial conversation is a discussion between two or more people where stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong. When we face crucial conversations, we can do one of three things: We can avoid them, we can face them and handle them poorly, or we can face them and handle them well. Ironically, the more crucial the conversation, the less likely we are to handle it well. We often hold things inside by going silent until we can take it no longerand then we drop a bomb. In short, we move between silence and violencewe either dont handle the conversation, or dont handle it well. We may not become physically violent, but we do attack others ideas and feelings. When we fail a crucial conversation, every aspect of our lives can be affectedfrom our careers, to our communities, to our relationships, to our personal health."
"We (the authors) didnt always spend our time noodling over crucial conversations. In fact, we started our research by studying a slightly different topic. We figured that if we could learn why certain people were more effective than others, then we could learn exactly what they did, clone it, and pass it on to others. To find the source of success, we started at work. We asked people to identify who they thought were their most effective colleagues. In fact, over the past twenty-five years, weve asked over 20,000 people to identify the individuals in their organizations who could really get things done. We wanted to find those who were not just influential, but who were far more influential than the rest. Each time, as we compiled the names into a list, a pattern emerged. Some people were named by one or two colleagues. Some found their way onto the lists of five or six people. These were the ones good at influence, but not good enough to be widely identified as top performers. And then there were the handful who were named thirty or more times. These were the best the clear opinion leaders in their areas. Some were managers and supervisors. Many were not. One of the opinion leaders we became particularly interested in meeting was named Kevin. He was the only one of eight vice presidents in his company to be identified as exceedingly influential. We wanted to know why. So we watched him at work. At first, Kevin didnt do anything remarkable. In truth, he looked like every other VP. He answered his phone, talked to his direct reports, and continued about his pleasant, but routine, routine. The Startling Discovery After trailing Kevin for almost a week, we began to wonder if he really did act in ways that set him apart from others or if his influence was simply a matter of popularity. And then we followed Kevin into a meeting. Kevin, his peers, and their boss were deciding on a new location for their officeswould they move across town, across the state, or across the country? The first two execs presented their arguments for their top choices, and as expected, their points were greeted by penetrating questions from the full team. No vague claim went unclarified, no unsupported reasoning unquestioned. Then Chris, the CEO, pitched his preferenceone that was both unpopular and potentially disastrous. However, when people tried to disagree or push back on Chris, he responded poorly. Since he was the big boss, he didnt exactly have to browbeat people to get what he wanted. Instead, he became slightly defensive. First he raised an eyebrow. Then he raised his finger. Finally he raised his voicejust a little. It wasnt long until people stopped questioning him, and Chriss inadequate proposal was quietly accepted. Well almost. Thats when Kevin spoke up. His words were simple enoughsomething like, Hey Chris, can I check something out with you? The reaction was stunningeveryone in the room stopped breathing. But Kevin ignored the apparent terror of his colleagues and plunged on ahead. In the next few minutes he in essence told the CEO that he appeared to be violating his own decision-making guidelines. He was subtly using his power to move the new offices to his hometown. Kevin continued to explain what he saw happening, and when he finished the first minutes of this delicate exchange, Chris was quiet for a moment. Then he nodded his head. Youre absolutely right, he finally concluded. I have been trying to force my opinion on you. Lets back up and try again. This was a crucial conversation, and Kevin played no games whatsoever. He didnt resort to silence like his colleagues, nor did he try to force his arguments on others. Somehow he managed to achieve absolute candor, but he did so in a way that showed deep respect for Chris. It was a remarkable thing to watch. As a result, the team chose a far more reasonable location and Kevins boss appreciated his caring coaching. When Kevin was done, one of his peers turned to us and said, Did you see how he did that? If you want to know how he gets things done, figure out what he just did. So we did. In fact, we spent the next twenty-five years discovering what Kevin and people like him do. What typically set them apart from the rest of the pack was their ability to avoid what we came to call the Fools Choice . You see, Kevins contribution was not his insight. Almost everyone could see what was happening. They knew they were allowing themselves to be steamrolled into making a bad decision. But everyone besides Kevin believed they had to make a choice between two bad alternatives.  Option 1: Speak up and turn the most powerful person in the company into their sworn enemy.  Option 2: Suffer in silence and make a bad decision that might ruin the company. The mistake most of us make in our crucial conversations is we believe that we have to choose between telling the truth and keeping a friend. We begin believing in the Fools Choice from an early age. For instance, we learned that when Grandma served an enormous wedge of her famous Brussel-Sprout Pie  la mode then asks, Do you like it?she really meant: Do you like me ? When we answered honestly and saw the look of hurt and horror on her facewe made a decision that affected the rest of our lives: From this day forward, I will be alert for moments when I must choose between candor and kindness. Beyond the Fools Choice And from that day forward, we find plenty of those momentswith bosses, colleagues, loved ones, and line cutters. And the consequences can be disastrous. Thats why our discovery of Kevin (and hundreds of individuals like him) was so important. We discovered a cadre of human beings who refuse to make the Fools Choice. Their goal is different from your average persons. Consider Kevin, the all-star. When he took a breath and opened his mouth, his overriding question was, How can I be 100 percent honest with Chris, and at the same time be 100 percent respectful?Following that consequential meeting, we began looking for more Kevins, and we found them all over the world. We found them in industry, government, academia, and nonprofit organizations. They were fairly easy to locate because they were almost always among the most influential employees in their organizations. They not only refused to make the Fools Choice, but they then acted in ways that were far more skilled than their colleagues. But what exactly did they do? Kevin wasnt that different. He did step up to a tough issue and help the team make a better choice, but was what he did more magical than manageable? Could what he did be learned by others? To answer these questions, first lets explore what Kevin was able to achieve . This will help us see where were trying to go. Then well examine the dialogue tools that effective communicators routinely use and learn to apply them to our own crucial conversations. DIALOGUE When it comes to risky, controversial, and emotional conversations, skilled people find a way to get all relevant information (from themselves and others) out into the open. Thats it. At the core of every successful conversation lies the free flow of relevant information. People openly and honestly express their opinions, share their feelings, and articulate their theories. They willingly and capably share their views, even when their ideas are controversial or unpopular. Its the one thing that, and precisely what, Kevin and the other extremely effective communicators we studied were routinely able to achieve. Now, to put a label on this spectacular talentits called dialogue. dialogue or dialog (d ? ?-lg ? ?, -lg) n The free flow of meaning between two or more people. Now, although we know what people like Kevin are trying to achieve, were still left with two questions. First, how does this free flow of meaning lead to success? Second, what can you do to encourage meaning to flow freely? Well explain the relationship between the free flow of meaning and success right here and now. The second questionwhat you must do in order to achieve dialogue rather than make the Fools Choice, no matter the circumstanceswill take us the rest of the book to answer. Filling the Pool of Shared Meaning Each of us enters conversations with our own opinions, feelings, theories, and experiences about the topic at hand. This unique combination of thoughts and feelings makes up our personal pool of meaning. This pool not only informs us, but also propels our every action. When two or more of us enter crucial conversations, by definition we dont share the same pool. Our opinions differ. I believe one thing; you another. I have one history; you another. People who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pooleven ideas that at first glance appear controversial, wrong, or at odds with their own beliefs. Now, obviously, they dont agree with every idea; they simply do their best to ensure that all ideas find their way into the open. As the Pool of Shared Meaning grows, it helps people in two ways. First, as individuals are exposed to more accurate and relevant information, they make better choices. In a very real sense, the Pool of Shared Meaning is a measure of a groups IQ. The larger the shared pool, the smarter the decisions. And even though many people may be involved in a choice, when people openly and freely share ideas, the increased time investment is more than offset by the quality of the decision. On the other hand, weve all seen what happens when the shared pool is dangerously shallow. When people purposefully withhold meaning from one another, individually smart people can do collectively stupid things. For example, a client of ours shared the following story. A woman checked into the hospital to have a tonsillectomy, and the surgical team erroneously removed a portion of her foot. How could this tragedy happen? In fact, why is it that nearly 200,000 hospital deaths in the United States each year stem from human error? 1 In part because many health-care professionals are afraid to speak their minds. In this case, no less than seven people wondered why the surgeon was working on the foot, but said nothing. Meaning didnt flow freely because people were afraid to speak up. Of course, hospitals dont have a monopoly on fear. In every instance where bosses are smart, highly paid, confident, and outspoken (i.e., most of the world), people tend to hold back their opinions rather than risk angering someone in a position of power. On the other hand, when people feel comfortable speaking up and meaning does flow freely, the shared pool can dramatically increase a groups ability to make better decisions. Consider what happened to Kevins group. As everyone on the team began to explain his or her opinion, people formed a clearer and more complete picture of the circumstances. As they began to understand the whys and wherefores of different proposals, they built off one another. Eventually, as one idea led to the next, and then to the next, they came up with an alternative that no one had originally thought of and that all wholeheartedly supported. As a result of the free flow of meaning, the whole (final choice) was truly greater than the sum of the original parts. In short: The Pool of Shared Meaning is the birthplace of synergy . Not only does a shared pool help individuals make better choices, but since the meaning is shared , people willingly act on whatever decisions they makewith both unity and conviction. As people sit through an open discussion where ideas are shared, they take part in the free flow of meaning. Eventually, they understand why the shared solution is the best solution, and theyre committed to act. For example, Kevin and the other VPs didnt buy into their final choice simply because they were involved; they bought in because they understood. Conversely, when people arent involved, when they sit back quietly during touchy conversations, theyre rarely committed to the final decision. Since their ideas remain in their heads and their opinions never make it into the pool, they end up quietly criticizing and passively resisting. Worse still, when others force their ideas into the pool, people have a harder time accepting the information. They may say theyre on board, but then walk away and follow through halfheartedly. To quote Samuel Butler, He that complies against his will is of his own opinion still. The time you spend up front establishing a shared pool of meaning is more than paid for by faster, more unified, and more committed action later on. For example, if Kevin and the other leaders had not been committed to their relocation decision, terrible consequences would have followed. Some people would have agreed to move; others would have dragged their feet. Some would have held heated discussions in the hallways. Others would have said nothing and then quietly fought the plan. More likely than not, the team would have been forced to meet again, discuss again, anddecide againsince only one person favored the decision and the decision affected everyone. Now, dont get us wrong. Were not suggesting that every decision be made by consensus or that the boss shouldnt take part in or even make the final choice. Were simply suggesting that whatever the decision-making method, the greater the shared meaning in the pool, the better the choice, the more the unity, and the stronger the convictionwhoever makes the choice. Every time we find ourselves arguing, debating, running away, or otherwise acting in an ineffective way, its because we dont know how to share meaning. Instead of engaging in healthy dialogue, we play silly and costly games. For instance, sometimes we move to silence. We play Salute and Stay Mute. That is, we dont confront people in positions of authority. Or at home we may play Freeze Your Lover. With this tortured technique, we give loved ones the cold shoulder in order to get them to treat us better (whats the logic in that?). Sometimes we rely on hints, sarcasm, caustic humor, innuendo, and looks of disgust to make our points. We play the martyr and then pretend were actually trying to help. Afraid to confront an individual, we blame an entire team for a problemhoping the message will hit the right target. Whatever the technique, the overall method is the same. We withhold meaning from the pool. We go to silence. On other occasions, not knowing how to stay in dialogue, we try to force our meaning into the pool. We rely on violenceanything from subtle manipulation to verbal attacks. We act like we know everything, hoping people will believe our arguments. We discredit others, hoping people wont believe their arguments. And then we use every manner of force to get our way or possibly even harm others. We borrow power from the boss; we hit people with biased monologues; we make hurtful comments. The goal, of course, is always the sameto compel others to our point of view. Now, heres how the various elements fit together. When stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong, were often at our worst. In order to move to our best, we have to find a way to explain what is in each of our personal pools of meaningespecially our high-stakes, sensitive, and controversial opinions, feelings, and ideasand to get others to share their pools. We have to develop the tools that make it safe for us to discuss these issues and to come to a shared pool of meaning. And when we do, our lives change. DIALOGUE SKILLS ARE LEARNABLE And now for the really good news. The skills required to master high-stakes interactions are quite easy to spot and moderately easy to learn. First consider the fact that a well-handled crucial conversation all but leaps out at you. In fact, when you see someone enter the dangerous waters of a high-stakes, high-emotion, controversial discussionand the person does a particularly good jobyour natural reaction is to step back in awe. Wow! is generally the first word out of your mouth. What starts as a doomed discussion ends up with a healthy resolution. It can take your breath away. More important, not only are dialogue skills easy to spot, but theyre also fairly easy to learn. Thats where were going next. Weve isolated and ca
tured the skills of the dialogue-gifted through twenty-five years of nonstop Wow! research. First, we followed around Kevin and others like him. Then, when conversations turned crucial , we took detailed notes. Afterward, we compared our observations, tested our hypotheses, and honed our models until we found the skills that consistently explain the success of brilliant communicators. Finally, we combined our philosophies, theories, models, and skills into a package of learnable toolstools for talking when stakes are high. We then taught these skills and watched as key performance indicators and relationships improved. Now were ready to share what weve learned. Stay with us as we explore how to transform crucial conversations from frightening events into interactions that yield success and results. Its the most important set of skills youll ever master. HERES WHERE WERE GOING Throughout the remainder of the book well explore the tools people use to help create the conditions of dialogue. The focus is on how we think about problem situations and what we do to prepare for them. As we work on ourselves, watch for problems, examine our own thought processes, discover our own styles, and then catch problems before they get out of hand, everyone benefits. As you read on, you will learn how to createconditions in yourself and others that make dialogue the path of least resistance . Next, well examine the tools for talking, listening, and acting together. This is what most people have in mind when they think of crucial conversations. How do I express delicate feedback? How do I speak persuasively, not abrasively? And how about listening? Or better still, what can we do to get people to talk when they seem nervous? And how do we move from thought to action? As you read on, you will learn the key skills of talking, listening, and acting together . Finally, well tie all of the theories and skills together by providing both a model and an extended example. Then, to see if you can really do what it takes, we provide seventeen situations that would give most of us fitseven people who are gifted at dialogue. As you read on, you will master the tools for talking when stakes are high .",Crucial Conversations - Mastering Crucial Conversations: The Power of Dialogue,"Dialogue is the free flow of meaning between two or more people. At the center of dialogue lies a Pool of Shared Meaning. It contains the ideas, theories, feelings, thoughts, and opinions that are openly shared. The more information we have in the pool, the better prepared we are to make decisions and get results. Anything less than total candor shrinks the shared pool, saps motivation, and dumbs down decisions. Taking time to fill the pool leads to faster and more effective results than the game-playing that inevitably follows silence and violence strategies. Dialogue takes time. The alternative takes longer."
"Its time to turn to the how of dialogue. How do you encourage the flow of meaning in the face of differing opinions and strong emotions? Given the average persons track record, it cant be all that easy. In fact, given that most peoples style is based on longstanding habits, itll probably require a lot of effort. The truth is, people can change. In fact, weve trained these skills to millions around the world and have seen dramatic improvements in results and relationships. But it requires work. You cant simply drink a magic potion and walk away changed. Instead, youll need to take a long, hard look at yourself. In fact, this is the first principle of dialogueStart with Heart. That is, your own heart. If you cant get yourself right, youll have a hard time getting dialogue right. When conversations become crucial, youll resort to the forms of communication that youve grown up withdebate, silent treatment, manipulation, and so on. WORK ON ME FIRST, US SECOND Lets start with a true story. Two young sisters and their father scurry into their hotel room after spending a hot afternoon at Disneyland. Given the repressive heat, the girls have consumed enough soda pop to fill a small barrel. As the two bursting kids enter their room, they have but one thought to head for the head. Since the bathroom is a one-holer, it isnt long until a fight breaks out. Both of the desperate children start arguing, pushing, and name-calling as they dance around the tiny bathroom. Eventually one calls out to her father for help. Dad, I got here first! I know, but I need to go worse! How do you know? Youre not in my body. I didnt even go before we left this morning! Youre so selfish. Dad proposes a plan. Girls, Im not going to solve this for you. You can stay in the bathroom and figure out who goes first and who goes second. Theres only one rule. No hitting. As the two antsy kids begin their crucial conversation, Dad checks his watch. He wonders how long itll take. As the minutes slowly tick away, he hears nothing more than an occasional outburst of sarcasm. Finally after twenty-five long minutes, the toilet flushes. One girl comes out. A minute later, another flush and out walks her sister. With both girls in the room, Dad asks, Do you know how many times both of you could have gone to the bathroom in the time it took you to work that out? The idea had not occurred to the little scamps. Dad then probed further, Why did it take so long for two of you to use the restroom? Because shes always so selfish! Listen to her. Shes calling me names when she could have just waited. She always has to have her way! Both girls claimed what they wanted most was to go to the bathroom. Then they behaved in ways that ensured the bathroom was little more than a distant dream. And thats the first problem we face in our crucial conversations. Our problem is not that our behavior degenerates. Its that our motives doa fact that we usually miss. So the first step to achieving the results we really want is to fix the problem of believing that others are the source of all that ails us. Its our dogmatic conviction that if we could just fix those losers, all would go better that keeps us from taking action that could lead to dialogue and progress. Which is why its no surprise that those who are best at dialogue tend to turn this logic around. They believe the best way to work on us is to start with me. DONT LOOK AT ME ! Although its true that there are times when we are merely bystanders in lifes never ending stream of head-on collisions, rarely are we completely innocent. More often than not, we do something to contribute to the problems were experiencing. People who are best at dialogue understand this simple fact and turn it into the principle Work on me first, us second. They realize not only that they are likely to benefit by improving their own approach, but also that theyre the only person they can work on anyway. As much as others may need to change, or we may want them to change, the only person we can continually inspire, prod, and shapewith any degree of successis the person in the mirror. Theres a certain irony embedded in this fact. People who believe they need to start with themselves do just that. As they work on themselves, they also become the most skilled at dialogue. So heres the irony. Its the most talented, not the least talented, who are continually trying to improve their dialogue skills. As is often the case, the rich get richer. START WITH HEART Okay, lets assume we need to work on our own personal dialogue skills. Instead of buying this book and then handing it to a loved one or coworker and saying: Youll love this, especially the parts that Ive underlined for you, well try to figure out how we ourselves can benefit. But how? Where do we start? How can we stay clear of unhealthy games? Although its difficult to describe the specific order of events in an interaction as fluid as a crucial conversation, we do know one thing for certain: Skilled people Start with Heart. That is, they begin high-risk discussions with the right motives, and they stay focused no matter what happens. They maintain this focus in two ways. First, theyre steely eyed smart when it comes to knowing what they want. Despite constant invitations to slip away from their goals, they stick with them. Second, skilled people dont make Fools Choices (either/or choices). Unlike others who justify their unhealthy behavior by explaining that they had no choice but to fight or take flight, the dialogue-smart believe that dialogue, no matter the circumstances, is always an option.Lets look at each of these important heart-based assumptions in turn. A MOMENT OF TRUTH To see how the desires of our hearts can affect our ability to stay in dialogue, lets take a look at a real-life example. Greta, the CEO of a midsized corporation, is two hours into a rather tense meeting with her top leaders. For the past six months, she has been on a personal campaign to reduce costs. Little has been accomplished to date, so Greta calls the meeting. Surely people will tell her why they havent started cutting costs. After all, she has taken great pains to foster candor. Greta has just opened the meeting to questions when a manager haltingly rises to his feet, fidgets, stares at the floor, and then nervously asks if he can ask a very tough question. The way the fellow emphasizes the word very makes it sound as if hes about to accuse Greta of kidnapping the Lindbergh baby. The frightened manager continues. Greta, youve been at us for six months to find ways to cut costs. Id be lying if I said that weve given you much more than a lukewarm response. If you dont mind, Id like to tell you about one thing thats making it tough for us to push for cost cuts. Great. Fire away, Greta says as she smiles in response. Well, while youve been asking us to use both sides of our paper and forgo improvements, youre having a second office built. Greta freezes and turns bright red. Everyone looks to see what will happen next. The manager plunges on ahead. The rumor is that the furniture alone will cost $150,000. Is that right? So there we have it. The conversation has just turned crucial. Someone has just poured a rather ugly tidbit into the pool of meaning. Will Greta continue to encourage honest feedback, or will she shut the fellow down? We call this a crucial conversation because how Greta acts during the next few moments will not only set peoples attitudes toward the proposed cost-cutting initiative, but will also have a huge impact on what the other leaders think about her. Does she walk the talk of openness and honesty? Or is she a raging hypocritelike so many of the senior executives who came before her? What Is She Acting Like She Wants? As we watch Greta, something quite subtle and yet very important takes place. It is lost on most of the people in the roombut with our front-row seat, it is practically palpable. Gretas jaw tightens. She leans forward and grips the left side of the rostrum hard enough that her knuckles turn white. She lifts her right hand, with the finger pointing at the questioner like a loaded weapon. She hasnt said anything yet, but it is clear where Greta is heading. Her motive has clearly changed from making the right choice to something far less noble. Like most of us in similar circumstances, Greta is no longer focused on cost-cutting. Her attention is now turned to staff-cuttingbeginning with one particular staff member. When under attack, our heart can take a similarly sudden and unconscious turn. When faced with pressure and strong opinions, we often stop worrying about the goal of adding to the pool of meaning and start looking for ways to win, punish, or keep the peace. Winning . This particular dialogue killer sits at the top of many of our lists. Heaven only knows that we come by this deadly passion naturally enough. Half of the TV programs we watch make heroes out of people who win at sports or game shows. Ten minutes into kindergarten we learn that if we want to get the teachers attention, we have to spout the right answer. That means we have to beat our fellow students at the same game. This desire to win is built into our very fiber before were old enough to know whats going on. Unfortunately, as we grow older, most of us dont realize that this desire to win is continually driving us away from healthy dialogue. We start out with the goal of resolving a problem, but as soon as someone raises the red flag of inaccuracy or challenges our correctness, we switch purposes in a heartbeat. First, we correct the facts. We quibble over details and point out flaws in the other persons arguments. Youre wrong! Were not spending anywhere near $150,000 on the furniture. Its the redesign of the office thats costing so much, not the furniture. Of course, as others push back, trying to prove their points, its not long until we change our goal from correcting mistakes to winning. If you doubt this simple allegation, think of the two antsy young girls as they stared each other down in the cramped bathroom. Their original goal was simple enoughrelief. But soon, caught up in their own painful game, the two set their jaws and committed to doing whatever it took to win even if it brought them a fair amount of personal discomfort. Punishing . Sometimes, as our anger increases, we move from wanting to win the point to wanting to harm the other person. Just ask Greta. To heck with honest communication! she thinks to herself. Ill teach the moron not to attack me in public. Eventually, as emotions reach their peak, our goal becomes completely perverted. We move so far away from adding meaning to the pool that now all we want is to see others suffer. I cant believe that youre accusing me of squandering good money on a perfectly fine office. Now, if nobody else has any intelligent questions, lets move on! Everyone immediately clams up and looks at the floor. The silence is deafening. Keeping the peace . Of course, we dont always fix mistakes, aggressively discredit others, or heartlessly try to make them suffer. Sometimes we choose personal safety over dialogue. Rather than add to the pool of meaning, and possibly make waves along the way, we go to silence. Were so uncomfortable with the immediate conflict that we accept the certainty of bad results to avoid the possibility of uncomfortable conversation. We choose (at least in our minds) peace over conflict. Had this happened in Gretas case, nobody would have raised concerns over the new office, Greta never would have learned the real issue, and people would have continued to drag their feet. FIRST, FOCUS ON WHAT YOU REALLY WANT In reality, Greta didnt give in to her raging desire to defend herself. Almost as soon as her finger rose like a loaded pistol, it dropped back to herside. Her face relaxed. At first she looked surprised, embarrassed, and maybe even a little upset. But then she took a deep breath and said: You know what? We need to talk about this. Im glad you asked the question. Thank you for taking that risk. I appreciate the trust it shows in me. Wow. We were struck. In a matter of seconds she had transformed from a dangerous weapon into a curious partner. And then Greta talked turkey. She acknowledged the apparent hypocrisy in talking cost cutting while spending on a new office. She admitted that she did not know what the project would cost and asked someone to leave the meeting to check the numbers. She explained that building the office was a response to marketings advice to boost the companys image and improve client confidence. And while Greta would use the office, it would be primarily a hosting location for marketing. But, she added, I have not managed this project as tightly as Im asking you to manage yours. And thats hypocritical. When she saw the figures for the office, Greta was stunned and admitted that she should have checked the costs before signing a work order. A wonderfully candid exchange followed wherein various participants in the meeting expressed their views about the propriety of the project. In the end, they agreed to move ahead, but cut the costs by half or cancel the project entirely. While others were engaged in this crucial conversation, those of us studying the interaction were thinking of something entirely different. We were wondering what had happened to Greta? How, we puzzled, did she remain so composed while under fire? Specifically, how did she move so quickly from wanting to get even with or possibly even humiliate the questioner to sincerely soliciting feedback? Later that day we asked Greta about that transformation. We wanted to know exactly what had been going on in her head. What had helped her move from embarrassment and anger to gratitude? It was easy, Greta explained. At first I did feel attacked, and I wanted to strike back. To be honest, I wanted to put that guy in his place. He was accusing me in public, and he was wrong. And then it struck me, she continued. Despite the fact that I had 400 eyeballs pinned to me, a rather important question hit me like a ton of bricks: What do I really want here? Asking this question had a powerful effect on Gretas thinking. As she focused on this far more important question, she quickly realized that her goal was to encourage these 200 managers to embrace the cost-reduction effortsand to thereby influence thousands of others to do the same. As Greta contemplated this goal, she realized that the biggest barrier she faced was the widespread belief that she was a hypocrite. On the one hand, she was calling for others to sacrifice. On the other, she appeared to be spending discretionary funds for her own comfort. It was at that moment that she was no longer ashamed or angry, but grateful. Interestingly, by transforming her motives Greta simultaneously transformed the way she saw the man who asked the question. Whereas seconds earlier he looked like an enemy, when her motives changed, the fellow now looked like an ally. In fact, this man had just handed her the best chance she could get to influence the audience by letting her publicly address a primary source of resistance to the cost-cutting effort. And so Greta moved to dialogue. Greta taught us that a small, mental interventionthe simple act of asking a potent questioncan have a powerful effect on redirecting our hearts. Refocus your brain . Now, lets move to a situation you might face. Youre speaking with someone who completely disagrees with you on a hot issue. How does all of this goal stuff apply? As you begin the discussion, start by examining your motives. Going in, ask yourself what you really want. Also, as the conversation unfolds and you find yourself starting to, say, defer to the boss or give your spouse the cold shoulder, pay attention to whats happening to your objectives. Are you starting to change your goal to save face, avoid embarrassment, win, be right, or punish others? Heres the tricky part. Our motives usually change without any conscious thought on our part. When adrenaline does our thinking for us, our motives flow with the chemical tide. In order to move back to motives that allow f
r dialogue, you must step away from the interaction and look at yourselfmuch like an outsider. Ask yourself: What am I doing, and if I had to guess, what does it tell me about my underlying motive? As you make an honest effort to discover your motive, you might conclude: Lets see. Im pushing hard, making the argument stronger than I actually believe, and doing anything to win. Ive shifted from trying to select a vacation location to trying to win an argument. Once you call into question the shifting desires of your heart, you can make conscious choices to change them. What I really want is to genuinely try to select a vacation spot we can all enjoyrather than try to win people over to my ideas. Put succinctly, when you name the game, you can stop playing it. But how? How do you recognize what has happened to you, stop playing games, and then influence your own motives? Do what Greta did. Stop and ask yourself some questions that return you to dialogue. You can ask these questions either when you find yourself slipping out of dialogue or as reminders when you prepare to step up to a crucial conversation. Here are some great ones: What do I really want for myself? What do I really want for others? What do I really want for the relationship? Once youve asked yourself what you want, add one more equally telling question: How would I behave if I really wanted these results? Find your bearings . There are two good reasons for asking these questions. First, the answer to what we really want helps us to locate our own North Star. Despite the fact that were being tempted to take the wrong path by (1) people who are trying to pick a fight, (2) thousands of years of genetic hard wiring that brings our emotions to a quick boil, and (3) our deeply ingrained habit of trying to win, our North Star returns us to our original purpose. What do I really want? Oh yeah, I guess its not to make the other person squirm or to preen in front of a crowd. I want people to freely and openly talk about what itll take to cut costs. Take charge of your body . The second reason for asking what we really want is no less important. When we ask ourselves what we really want, we affect our entire physiology. As we introduce complex and abstract questions to our mind, the problem-solving part of our brain recognizes that we are now dealing with intricate social issues and not physical threats. When we present our brain with a demanding question, our body sends precious blood to the parts of our brain that help us think and away from the parts of our body that help us take flight or begin a fight. Asking questions about what we really want serves two important purposes. First, it reminds us of our goal. Second, it juices up our brain in a way that helps us keep focused.SECOND, REFUSE THE FOOLS CHOICE Now, lets add one more tool that helps us focus on what we really want. Well start with a story. The faculty of Beaumont High School is hashing out possible curriculum changes in an after-school meeting thats been going on for hours. Its finally the science departments turn to present. Royce, a chemistry teacher whos been at Beaumont for thirty-three years, considers himself the elder statesman of the school. Hes much fonder of war stories than he is of neutrons and electrons, but the administration kind of turns a blind eye because the guys a fixture. At the principals cue, Royce clears his throat and begins to yammer on incoherently about the similarities between curriculum development and battle preparations. His antics are so embarrassing that the audience quietly heaves their shoulders as they futilely try to stifle their laughter. Next, its Brents, the new guys, turn. A couple of weeks ago, the principal asked him to outline the science departments proposed curriculum changes. Brent met with his colleagues (even Royce), gathered suggestions, and came ready to present. As Brent begins, Royce starts demonstrating bayonet offensives with a yardstick, and Brent snaps. Slamming his fist on the table, he shouts, Am I the only one who wonders why we even allow this fossil to talk? Did he miss a pill or something? A room full of stunned faces turns toward Brent. Realizing that his colleagues must think hes possessed, Brent utters those words weve all come to hate, Hey, dont look at me like that! Im the only one around who has the guts to speak the truth. What a tactic. Brent slams Royce in public, and then instead of apologizing or maybe simply fading into the shadows, he argues that what he just did was somehow noble. As we saw in the previous chapter with Kevins colleaguesunder the influence of adrenaline we start to see our options as unnecessarily limited. We assume we have to choose between getting results and keeping a relationship. In our dumbed-down condition, we dont even consider the option of achieving both. Thats why those who are skilled at crucial conversations present their brain with a more complex question. They routinely ask: What do I want for myself, the other person, and the relationship? As you practice presenting this question to yourself at emotional times, youll discover that at first you resist it. When our brain isnt functioning well, we resist complexity. We adore the ease of simply choosing between attacking or hidingand the fact that we think it makes us look good. Im sorry, but I just had to destroy the guys self-image if I was going to keep my integrity. It wasnt pretty, but it was the right thing to do. Fortunately, when you refuse the Fools Choicewhen you require your brain to solve the more complex problemmore often than not, it does just that. Youll find there is a way to share your concerns, listen sincerely to those of others, and build the relationshipall at the same time. And the results can be life changing. Search for the Elusive And The best at dialogue refuse Fools Choices by setting up new choices. They present themselves with tougher questionsquestions that turn the either/or choice into a search for the all-important and ever-elusive and . (It is an endangered species, you know.) Heres how this works. First, clarify what you really want . Youve got a head start if youve already Started with Heart. If you know what you want for yourself, for others, and for the relationship, then youre in position to break out of the Fools Choice. What I want is for my husband to be more reliable. Im tired of being let down by him when he makes commitments that I depend on. Second, clarify what you really dont want . This is the key to framing the and question. Think of what you are afraid will happen to you if you back away from your current strategy of trying to win or stay safe. What bad thing will happen if you stop pushing so hard? Or if you dont try to escape? What horrible outcome makes game playing an attractive and sensible option? What I dont want is to have a useless and heated conversation that creates bad feelings and doesnt lead to change. Third, present your brain with a more complex problem . Finally, combine the two into an and question that forces you to search for more creative and productive options than silence and violence. How can I have a candid conversation with my husband about being more dependable and avoid creating bad feelings or wasting our time? Its interesting to watch what happens when people are presented with and questions after being stuck with Fools Choices. Their faces become reflective, their eyes open wider, and they begin to think . With surprising regularity, when people are asked: Is it possible that theres a way to accomplish both? they acknowledge that there very well may be. Is there a way to tell your peer your real concerns and not insult or offend him? Is there a way to talk to your neighbors about their annoying behavior and not come across as self-righteous or demanding? Is there a way to talk with your loved one about how youre spending money and not get into an argument? IS THIS REALLY POSSIBLE? Some people believe that this whole line of thinking is comically unrealistic. From their point of view, Suckers Choices arent false dichotomies; theyre merely a reflection of an unfortunate reality. You cant say something to the boss about our upcoming move. Itll cost you your job. To these people we say: Remember Kevin? He, and almost every other opinion leader weve ever studied, has what it takes to speak up and maintain respect. Maybe you dont know what Kevin did or what you need to dobut dont deny the existence of Kevin or people like him. There is a third set of options out there that allows you to add meaning to the pool and build on the relationship. When we (the authors) are in the middle of an on-site workshop and we suggest there are alternatives to Fools Choices, someone invariably says: Maybe you can speak honestly and still be heard in other organizations, but if you try it here, youll be eaten alive! Or the flip side: Youve got to know when to fold if you want to survive for another day. Then in a hail of Ill say! and Here, here! many nod in agreement. At first, we thought that maybe there were places where dialogue couldnt survive. But then we learned to ask: Are you saying there isnt anyone you know who is able to hold a high-risk conversation in a way that solves problems and builds relationships? There usually is. SUMMARYSTART WITH HEART Heres how people who are skilled at dialogue stay focused on their goalsparticularly when the going gets tough. Work on Me First, Us Second  Remember that the only person you can directly control is yourself.Focus on What You Really Want  When you find yourself moving toward silence or violence, stop and pay attention to your motives.  Ask yourself: What does my behavior tell me about what my motives are?  Then, clarify what you really want. Ask yourself: What do I want for myself? For others? For the relationship?  And finally, ask: How would I behave if this were what I really wanted? Refuse the Fools Choice  As you consider what you want, notice when you start talking yourself into a Fools Choice.  Watch to see if youre telling yourself that you must choose between peace and honesty, between winning and losing, and so on.  Break free of these Fools Choices by searching for the and .  Clarify what you dont want, add it to what you do want, and ask your brain to start searching for healthy options to bring you to dialogue.",Crucial Conversations - Start with Heart: How to Stay Focused on What You Really Want,"In order to break away from silence and violence, we have to change our behavior. This calls first for a change in heart. Our first change in heart comes from realizing that as much fun as it would be to fix other people, we need to work on ourselves first. We need to examine our personal role in any problem we encounter. Our next change in heart comes with a change in motive. As we find ourselves forgetting our original goal of candidly and honestly adding meaning to the pool and instead striving to look good, win, or achieve some other unhealthy objective, we need to ask ourselves, What do I really want? Also, while its true that sometimes we are caught in a genuine dilemma with only two bad options, most of the time we do have healthy alternatives. When it comes to crucial conversations, and thinking makes a great deal of sense. Replacing either/or thinking with and thinking provides a way to reduce the ill effects of adrenaline. By asking ourselves the and question, we force our brains to move to higher-level, more complex thinking."
"Lets start this chapter by visiting a failed crucial conversation. Youve just ended a heated debate with a group of people you supervise. What started out as a harmless discussion about your new product timelines ended up as a nasty argument. After an hour of carping and complaining, you finally went to your separate corners. Youre now walking down the hall wondering what happened. In a matter of minutes, an innocent discussion had transformed into a crucial conversation and then into a failed conversationand you cant recall why. You do remember a tense moment when you started pushing your point of view a bit too hard (okay, maybe way too hard), and eight people stared at you as if you had just bitten the head off a chicken. But then the meeting ended. What you dont realize is that two of your friends are walking down the hallway in the opposite direction conducting a play-by-play of the meeting. They do know what took place. It happened again. The boss started pushing so hard for personal agenda items that we all began to act defensively. Did you notice how at one point all of our jaws dropped simultaneously? Of course, I was just as bad as the boss. I spoke in absolutes, only pointed out facts that supported my view, and then ended with a list of outlandish claims. I got hooked like a marlin. Later that day as you talk to your friends about the meeting, they let you in on what happened. You were there, but somehow you missed what actually happened . Thats because you were so caught up in the content of the conversation, your buddy explains. You cared so deeply about the product timelines that you were blind to the conditions . You knowhow people were feeling and acting, what tone they were taking, stuff like that. You saw all that while still carrying on a heated conversation? you ask. Yeah, your coworker explains, I always watch two elements. When things start turning ugly, I watch the content of the conversation (the topic under discussion) along with the conditions (what people are doing in response). I look for and examine both what and why . If you can see why people are becoming upset or holding back their views or even going silent, you can do something to get back on track. You look at the conditions, and then you know what to do to get back on track? Sometimes, your friend answers. But youve got to learn exactly what to look for. Its a form of social first aid. By watching for the moment a conversation starts turning unhealthy, you can respond quickly. The sooner you notice youre not in dialogue, the easier it is to get back and the lower the costs. But, your friend continues, the sad corollary is that the longer it takes to notice youre not in dialogue, the harder it is to get back and the higher the costs. You cant believe how obvious this advice isand yet youve never thought of such a thing. Weirder still, your friend has. In fact, he has a whole vocabulary for whats going on during a crucial conversation. Its as if youve been speaking another language. WATCH FOR CONDITIONS In truth, most of us do have trouble dual-processing (simultaneously watching for content and conditions)especially when both stakes and emotions are high. We get so caught up in what were saying that it can be nearly impossible to pull ourselves out of the argument in order to see whats happening to ourselves and to others. Even when we are startled by whats going on, enough so that we think, Yipes! This has turned ugly. Now what? we may not know what to look for in order to turn things around. We may not see enough of whats happening. How could that be? How could we be smack-dab in the middle of a heated debate and not really see whats going on? A metaphor might help. Its akin to fly fishing for the first time with an experienced angler. Your buddy keeps telling you to cast your fly six feet upstream from that brown trout just out there. Only you cant see a brown trout just out there. He can. Thats because he knows what to look for. You think you do. You think you need to look for a brown trout. In reality, you need to look for the distorted image of a brown trout thats underwater while the sun is reflecting in your eyes. You have to look for elements other than the thing that your dad has stuffed and mounted over the fireplace. It takes both knowledge and practice to know what to look for and then actually see it. So what do you look for when caught in the middle of a crucial conversation? What do you need to see in order to catch problems before they become too severe? Actually, it helps to watch for three different conditions: the moment a conversation turns crucial, signs that people dont feel safe (silence or violence), and your own Style Under Stress. Lets consider each of these conversation killers in turn. Learn to Spot Crucial Conversations First, stay alert for the moment a conversation turns from a routine or harmless discussion into a crucial one. In a similar vein, as you anticipate entering a tough conversation, pay heed to the fact that youre about to enter the danger zone. Otherwise, you can easily get sucked into silly games before you realize whats happened. And as we suggested earlier, the further you stray off track, the harder it can be to return and the higher the costs. To help catch problems early, reprogram your mind to pay attention to the signs that suggest youre in a crucial conversation. Some people first notice physical signalstheir stomach gets tight or their eyes get dry. Think about what happens to your body when conversations get tough. Everyone is a little bit different. What are your cues? Whatever they are, learn to look at them as signs to step back, slow down, and Start with Heart before things get out of hand. Others notice their emotions before they notice signs in their body. They realize they are scared, hurt, or angry and are beginning to react to or suppress these feelings. These emotions can also be great cues to tell you to step back, slow down, and take steps to turn your brain back on. Some peoples first cue is behavioral . For them its like an out-of-body experience. They see themselves raising their voice, pointing their finger like a loaded weapon, or becoming very quiet. Its only then that they realize how theyre feeling. So take a moment to think about some of your toughest conversations. What cues can you use to recognize that your brain is beginning todisengage and youre at risk of moving away from healthy dialogue? Learn to Look for Safety Problems If you can catch signs that the conversation is starting to turn crucialbefore you get sucked so far into the actual argument that you can never withdraw from the contentthen you can start dual-processing immediately. And what exactly should you watch for? People who are gifted at dialogue keep a constant vigil on safety . They pay attention to the contentthats a givenand they watch for signs that people are becoming fearful. When friends, loved ones, or colleagues move away from healthy dialogue (freely adding to the pool of meaning)either forcing their opinions into the pool or purposefully keeping their ideas out of the poolthey immediately turn their attention to whether or not others feel safe. When its safe, you can say anything . Heres why gifted communicators keep a close eye on safety. Dialogue calls for the free flow of meaning period. And nothing kills the flow of meaning like fear. When you fear that people arent buying into your ideas, you start pushing too hard. When you fear that you may be harmed in some way, you start withdrawing and hiding. Both these reactionsto fight and to take flightare motivated by the same emotion: fear. On the other hand, if you make it safe enough, you can talk about almost anything and people will listen. If you dont fear that youre being attacked or humiliated, you yourself can hear almost anything and not become defensive. This is a pretty remarkable claim. Think about it. Were suggesting that people rarely become defensive simply because of what youre saying. They only become defensive when they no longer feel safe. The problem is not the content of your message, but the condition of the conversation. As we saw earlier, from the time we are quite small we begin to conclude that you cant be both honest and respectful simultaneously. In essence, we conclude that there are some messages you just cant give to some people. And over time, that list of messages gets longer and longeruntil we find ourselves handling most crucial conversations badly. If what were suggesting here is true, then the problem is not the message. The problem is that you and I fail to help others feel safe hearing the message. If you can learn to see when people start to feel unsafe, you can take action to fix it. That means the first challenge is to simply see and understand that safety is at risk. Think about your own experience. Can you remember receiving really blistering feedback from someone at some point in your life, but in this instance you didnt become defensive? Instead, you absorbed the feedback. You reflected on it. You allowed it to influence you. If so, ask yourself why. Why in this instance were you able to absorb potentially threatening feedback so well? If youre like the rest of us, its because you believed that the other person had your best interest in mind. In addition, you respected the other persons opinion. You felt safe receiving the feedback because you trusted the motives and ability of the other person. You didnt need to defend yourself from what was being said even if you didnt like what they were saying! On the other hand, if you dont feel safe, you cant take any feedback. Its as if the pool of meaning has a lid on it. What do you mean I look good? Is that some kind of joke? Are you insulting me? When you dont feel safe, even well-intended comments are suspect. When its unsafe, you start to go blind . By carefully watching for safety violations, not only can you see when dialogue is in danger, but you can also reengage your brain. As weve said before, when your emotions start cranking up, key brain functions start shutting down. Not only do you prepare to take flight, but your peripheral vision actually narrows. In fact, when you feel genuinely threatened, you can scarcely see beyond whats right in front of you. By pulling yourself out of the content of an argument and looking for signs that safety is a risk, you reengage your brain and your full vision returns. As we suggested earlier, when you give your brain a new problem to consider (keep alert for signs that safety is at risk!), it affects your brain functioning. Your higher reasoning centers stay more active, and youre far less likely to be dumbed down and far more likely to succeed in your crucial conversation. Dont let safety problems lead you astray . Lets add a note of caution. When others begin to feel unsafe, they start acting in annoying ways. Now, since theyre feeling unsafe, you should be thinking to yourself: Hey, theyre feeling unsafe. I need to do somethingmaybe make it safer. Thats what you should be thinking. Unfortunately, since others feel unsafe, they may be trying to make fun of you, insult you, or bowl you over with their arguments. This kind of aggressive behavior doesnt exactly bring out the diplomat in you. So instead of taking their attack as a sign that safety is at risk, you take it at its faceas an attack. Im under attack! you think. Then the dumb part of your brain kicks in and you respond in kind. Or maybe you try to escape. Either way, youre not dual-processing and then pulling out a skill to restore safety. Instead, youre becoming part of the problem as you get pulled into the fight. Imagine the magnitude of what were suggesting here. Were asking you to recode silence and violence as signs that people are feeling unsafe. Were asking you to fight your natural tendency to respond in kind. Were asking you to undo years of practice, maybe even eons of genetic shaping that prod you to take flight or pick a fight (when under attack), and recode the stimulus. Ah, thats a sign that the other person feels unsafe. And then what? Do something to make it safe. Obviously, this can be a difficult undertaking. But its worth it. This skill is the pivot point for everything that follows. It is also the gateway to gaining all the benefits that come to those who are skilled at crucial conversations. Imagine increased influence, enhanced relationships, stronger teams, and more effective leadership. Turn on your capacity to recognize and respond to safety problems. In the next chapter well explore how. For now, simply learn to look for safety, and then be curious, not angry or frightened. Silence and Violence As people begin to feel unsafe, they start down one of two unhealthy paths. They move either to silence (withholding meaning from the pool) or to violence (trying to force meaning in the pool). That part we know. But lets add a little more detail. Just as a little knowledge of what to look for can turn blurry water into a brown trout, knowing a few of the common forms of silence and violence helps you see safety problems when they first start to happen. That way you can step out, restore safety, and return to dialoguebefore the damage is too great. Silence Silence consists of any act to purposefully withhold information from the pool of meaning. Its almost always done as a means of avoiding potential problems, and it always restricts the flow of meaning. Methods range from playing verbal games to avoiding a person entirely. The three most common forms of silence are masking, avoiding, and withdrawing.  Masking consists of understating or selectively showing our true opinions. Sarcasm, sugarcoating, and couching are some of the more popular forms. I think your idea is, uh, brilliant. Yeah, thats it. I just worry that others wont catch the subtle nuances. Some ideas come before their time, so expect some, uh, minor resistance.Meaning : Your idea is insane, and people will fight it with their last breath. Oh yeah, thatll work like a charm. Offer people a discount, and theyll drive all the way across town just to save six cents on a box of soap. Where do you come up with this stuff? Meaning : What a dumb idea.  Avoiding involves steering completely away from sensitive subjects. We talk, but without addressing the real issues. How does your new suit look? Well, you know that blues my favorite color. Meaning : What happened? Did you buy your clothes at the circus? Speaking of ideas for cost cuttingwhat if we diluted the coffee? Or used both sides of our copier paper? Meaning: If I offer trivial suggestions perhaps we can avoid discussing sensitive things like staff inefficiency.  Withdrawing means pulling out of a conversation altogether. We either exit the conversation or exit the room. Excuse me. Ive got to take this call. Meaning : Id rather gnaw off my own arm than spend one more minute in this useless meeting. Sorry, Im not going to talk about how to split up the phone bill again. Im not sure our friendship can stand another battle. (Exits.) Meaning : We cant talk about even the simplest of topics without arguing. Violence Violence consists of any verbal strategy that attempts to convince, control, or compel others to your point of view. It violates safety by trying to force meaning into the pool. Methods range from name-calling and monologuing to making threats. The three most common forms are controlling, labeling, and attacking.  Controlling consists of coercing others to your way of thinking. Its done through either forcing your views on others or dominating the conversation. Methods include cutting others off, overstating your facts, speaking in absolutes, changing subjects, or using directive questions to control the conversation. Theres not a person in the world who hasnt bought one of these things. Theyre the perfect gift. Meaning : I cant justify spending our hard-earned savings on this expensive toy, but I really want it. We tried their product, but it was an absolute disaster. Everyone knows that they cant deliver on time and that they offer the worst customer service on the p
anet. Meaning : Im not certain of the real facts, so Ill use hyperbole to get your attention.  Labeling is putting a label on people or ideas so we can dismiss them under a general stereotype or category. Your ideas are practically Neanderthal. Any thinking person would follow my plan. Meaning : I cant argue my case on its merits, so to get what I want Ill attack you personally. Youre not going to listen to them are you? For crying out loud! First, theyre from headquarters. Second, theyre engineers. Need I say more? Meaning : If I pretend that all people from headquarters and all engineers are somehow bad and wrong, I wont have to explain anything.  Attacking speaks for itself. Youve moved from winning the argument to making the person suffer. Tactics include belittling and threatening. Try that stupid little stunt and see what happens. Meaning : I will get my way on this even if I have to bad-mouth you and threaten some vague punishment. Dont listen to a word Jim is saying. Im sorry Jim, but Im on to you. Youre just trying to make it better for your team while making the rest of us suffer. Ive seen you do it before. Youre a real jerk, you know that? Im sorry, but someone has to have the guts to tell it like it is. Meaning: To get my way, Ill say bad things about you and then pretend that Im the only one with any integrity. Look for Your Style Under Stress Lets say youve been watching for both content and conditions. Youre paying special attention to when a conversation turns crucial. To catch this important moment, youre looking for signs that safety is at risk. As safety is violated, you even know to watch for various forms of silence and violence. So are you now fully armed? Have you seen all there is to see? Actually, no. Perhaps the most difficult element to watch closely as youre madly dual-processing is your own behavior. Frankly, most people have trouble pulling themselves away from the tractor beam of the argument at hand. Then youve got the problem other people present as they employ all kinds of tactics. Youve got to watch them like a hawk. Its little wonder that paying close attention to your own behavior tends to take a back-seat. Besides, its not like you can actually step out of your body and observe yourself. Youre on the wrong side of your eyeballs. Low self-monitors . The truth is, we all have trouble monitoring our own behavior at times. We usually lose any semblance of social sensitivity when we become so consumed with ideas and causes that we lose track of what were doing. We try to bully our way through. We speak when we shouldnt. We withdraw into a punishing silence. We do things that dont workall in the name of a cause. We eventually become so unaware that we become a bit like this fellow of Jack Handys invention.People were always talking about how mean this guy was who lived on our block. But I decided to go see for myself. I went to his door, but he said he wasnt the mean guy, the mean guy lived in that house over there. No, you stupid idiot, I said, thats my house. Unfortunately, when you fail to monitor your own behavior, you can look pretty silly. For example, youre talking to your spouse about the fact that he or she left you sitting at the auto repair shop for over an hour. After pointing out that it was a simple misunderstanding, your spouse exclaims: You dont have to get angry. Then you utter those famous words: Im not angry! Of course, youre spraying spit as you shout out your denial, and the vein on your forehead has swelled to the size of a teenage python. You, quite naturally, dont see the inconsistency in your response. Youre in the middle of the whole thing, and you dont appreciate it one bit when your spouse laughs at you. You also play this denial game when you ingenuously answer the question, Whats wrong? Nothings wrong, you whimper. Then you shuffle your feet, stare at the floor, and look wounded. Become a Vigilant Self-Monitor What does it take to be able to step out of an argument and watch for processincluding what you yourself are doing and the impact youre having? You have to become a vigilant self-monitor. That is, pay close attention to what youre doing and the impact its having, and then alter your strategy if necessary. Specifically, watch to see if youre having a good or bad impact on safety. Your Style Under Stress Test What kind of a self-monitor are you?

The sooner we notice were not in dialogue, the quicker we can get back to dialogue, and the lower the cost. As you pull out of the content of a conversation and learn to look for the conditions of dialogue, pay attention to early warning signs. Learn to look for when a conversation becomes crucial, for signs of silence and violence, and for your own style under stress. A large part of this is watching your actions and emotions, as well as the actions and emotions of the other person. Paying attention to both the content of the discussion and how people are acting and feeling is no easy task. But its an essential part of dialogue."
"The last chapter contained a promise: If you spot safety risks as they happen, you can step out of the conversation, build safety , and then find a way to talk about just about anything. In this chapter, well fulfill that promise by teaching what it takes to restore safety. To get started, lets eavesdrop on a couple as they try to discuss one of the most delicate of topicsphysical intimacy. First a little background. Jotham thinks he and Yvonne are intimate with each other far too seldom. Yvonne is satisfied with their physical relationship. For years, the two have acted out rather than talked out their concerns. When Jotham wants to be amorous and Yvonne doesnt respond, he goes to silence. He pouts, says almost nothing, and avoids Yvonne for the next few days. Yvonne knows whats going on with Jotham. Occasionally shell go along with him even when shes not feeling particularly romantic. She does this in hopes of avoiding Jothams pouting. Unfortunately, she then feels resentful toward Jotham, and its much longer before she feels genuinely affectionate toward him. So heres the game. The more Jotham insists and pouts, the less attractive and interesting he is to Yvonne. The more Yvonne succumbs and then resents, the less shes interested in the relationship. The more both of them act out rather than talk out this crucial conversation, the more likely they are to end up going their separate ways. Yvonne has decided to broach the subject with Jotham. Rather than waiting until theyre both upset, shes picked a time when theyre relaxing on the couch. Here goes. Y VONNE : Jotham, can we talk about what happened last nightyou know, when I told you that I was tired? J OTHAM : I dont know if Im in the mood. Y VONNE : Whats that supposed to mean? J OTHAM : Im sick and tired of you deciding when we do what! Y VONNE : ( walks out ) STEP OUT. MAKE IT SAFE. THEN STEP BACK IN Okay, lets look at Yvonne. She tried to tackle a tough topic. Good for her. She was already uncomfortable and her partner took a cheap shot at her. Some help he was. Now what should she do? How can she get back to honest and healthy dialogue? What do you do when you dont feel like its safe to share whats on your mind? The key is to step out of the content of the conversation. Dont stay stuck in whats being said. Yvonne exited because she was focused on what Jotham was saying. If she had been looking at Jothams conditions of dialogue, she would have spotted his use of sarcasma form of silence . Rather than talking openly about his concern and adding to the Pool of Shared Meaning, hes taking a potshot. Why would he do that? Because he doesnt feel safe using dialogue . Unfortunately, Yvonne then missed this point. Now, were not suggesting that Jothams behavior is acceptable, or that Yvonne should put up with it. But first things firstStart with Heart. The first question is: What do I really want? If you really want to have a healthy conversation about a topic that will make or break your relationship, then for a moment or two you may have to set aside confronting the current issuei.e., Jothams sarcasm. At this moment, Yvonne needs to build safetyenough to talk about their physical relationship, about the way Jotham is dealing with it, or about any other concerns. But if she doesnt make it safe, all shes going to experience is an unhealthy continuation of the silence and violence games. So, what should she do? In these circumstances, the worst at dialogue do what both Jotham and Yvonne did. Like Jotham, they totally ignore the crying need for more safety. They say whatever is on their minds with no regard for how it will be received. Or like Yvonne, they conclude the topic is completely unsafe and move to silence. The good realize that safety is at risk, but they fix it in exactly the wrong way. They try to make the subject more palatable by sugarcoating their message. Oh, honey, I really want to be with you but Im under a lot of pressure at work, and the stress makes it hard for me to enjoy our time together. They try to make things safer by watering down or dressing up their content. This strategy, of course, avoids the real problem, and it never gets fixed. The best dont play games. Period. They know that in order to solve their problem, theyll need to talk about their problemwith no pretending, sugarcoating, or faking. So they do something completely different. They step out of the content of the conversation, make it safe, and then step back in. Once safety is restored, they can talk about nearly anything. For example, Yvonne gets back on the path of dialogue by saying: Can we change gears for a minute? Id like to talk about what happens when were not romantically in sync. It would be good if we could both share whats working and what isnt. My goal isnt to make you feel guilty, and I certainly dont want to become defensive. What Id really love is for us to come up with a solution that makes us both satisfied in our relationship. NOTICE WHICH CONDITION IS AT RISK Now, lets look at what Yvonne just did to establish safetyeven though the topic was high risk, controversial, and emotional. She realized that the first step to building safety comes with understanding which of two different conditions of safety is at risk. Each requires a different solution. Mutual Purposethe Entrance Condition Why Talk in the First Place?Remember the last time someone gave you difficult feedback and you didnt become defensive? Say a friend said some things to you that most people might get upset over. In order for this person to be able to deliver the delicate message, you must have believed he or she cared about you or about your goals and objectives. That means you trusted his or her purposes so you were willing to listen to some pretty tough feedback. Crucial conversations often go awry not because others dislike the content of the conversation, but because they believe the content (even if its delivered in a gentle way) suggests that you have a malicious intent . How can others feel safe when they believe youre out to harm them? Soon, every word out of your mouth is suspect. You cant utter a harmless good morning without others interpreting it in a negative way. Consequently, the first condition of safety is Mutual Purpose . Mutual Purpose means that others perceive that youre working toward a common outcome in the conversation, that you care about their goals, interests, and values. And vice versa. You believe they care about yours. Consequently, Mutual Purpose is the entry condition of dialogue. Find a shared goal, and you have both a good reason and a healthy climate for talking. For example, if Jotham believes that Yvonnes purpose in raising this delicate topic is to make him feel guilty or to get her way, this conversation is doomed from the outset. If he believes she really cares about making things better for both of them, she may have a chance. Watch for signs that Mutual Purpose is at risk . How do we know when the safety problem were seeing is due to a lack of Mutual Purpose? Its actually fairly easy to spot. First, when Mutual Purpose is at risk, we end up in debate. When others start forcing their opinions into the pool of meaning, its often because they figure that were trying to win and they need to do the same. Other signs that purpose is at risk include defensiveness, hidden agendas (the silence form of fouled-up purpose), accusations, and circling back to the same topic. Here are two crucial questions to help us determine when Mutual Purpose is at risk:  Do others believe I care about their goals in this conversation?  Do they trust my motives? Remember the Mutual in Mutual Purpose . Just a word to the wise. Mutual Purpose is not a technique. To succeed in crucial conversations, we must really care about the interests of othersnot just our own. The purpose has to be truly mutual. If our goal is to get our way or manipulate others, it will quickly become apparent, safety will be destroyed, and well be back to silence and violence in no time. Before you begin, examine your motives. Ask yourself the Start with Heart questions:  What do I want for me?  What do I want for others?  What do I want for the relationship? Look for the mutuality . Lets see how Mutual Purpose applies to a tough exampleone where, at first glance, it might appear as if your purpose is to make things better for yourself. How can you find Mutual Purpose in this? Lets say youve got a boss who frequently fails to keep commitments. How could you tell the boss you dont trust him? Surely theres no way to say this without the boss becoming defensive or vengeful, because he knows that your goal is merely to make your life better. To avoid disaster, find a Mutual Purpose that would be so motivating to the boss that hed want to hear your concerns. If your only reason for approaching the boss is to get what you want, the boss will hear you as critical and selfishwhich is what you are. In contrast, if you try to see the other persons point of view, you can often find a way to draw the other person willingly into even very sensitive conversations. For example, if the bosss behavior is causing you to miss deadlines he cares about, or incur costs he frets over, or lose productivity that he worries about, then youre onto a possible Mutual Purpose. Imagine raising the topic this way: Ive got some ideas for how I can be much more reliable and even reduce costs by a few thousand dollars in preparing the report each month. Its going to be a bit of a sensitive conversationbut I think it will help a great deal if we can talk about it. Mutual Respectthe Continuance Condition Will We Be Able to Remain in Dialogue? While its true that theres no reason to enter a crucial conversation if you dont have Mutual Purpose, its equally true that you cant stay in the conversation if you dont maintain Mutual Respect . Mutual Respect is the continuance condition of dialogue. As people perceive that others dont respect them, the conversation immediately becomes unsafe and dialogue comes to a screeching halt. Why? Because respect is like air. As long as its present, nobody thinks about it. But if you take it away, its all that people can think about. The instant people perceive disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purposeit is now about defending dignity. For example, youre talking with a group of supervisors about a complicated quality problem. You really want to see the problem resolved once and for all. Your job depends on it. Unfortunately, you also think the supervisors are overpaid and underqualified. You firmly believe that not only are they in over their heads, but they do stupid things all the time. Some of them even act unethically. As the supervisors throw out ideas, you roll your eyes. The disrespect you carry in your head and are trying to keep hidden creeps out in one unfortunate eye gesture. Its all over. Without mutual respect, the conversation tanks. The supervisors now take shots at your proposals. You add insulting adjectives in describing theirs. As attention turns to scoring points, everyone loses. Your Mutual Purpose suffers for a lack of Mutual Respect. Telltale signs . To spot when respect is violated and safety takes a turn south, watch for signs that people are defending their dignity. Emotions are the key. When people feel disrespected, they become highly charged. Their emotions turn from fear to anger. Then they resort to pouting, name-calling, yelling, and making threats. Ask the following question to determine when Mutual Respect is at risk:  Do others believe I respect them? Can You Respect People You Dont Respect? Some people fear theyll never be able to maintain Mutual Purpose or Mutual Respect with certain individuals or in certain circumstances. How, they wonder, can they share the same purpose with people who come from completely different backgrounds or whose morals or values differ from theirs? What do you do, for example, if youre upset because another person has let you down? And if this has repeatedly happened, how can yourespect a person who is so poorly motivated and selfish? Yvonne is struggling with this exact point. There are times when she doesnt even like Jotham. She sees him as whiny and self-centered. How can you speak respectfully with someone like that ? Dialogue truly would be doomed if we had to share every objective or respect every element of another persons character before we could talk. If this were the case, wed all be mute. However, we can stay in dialogue by finding a way to honor and regard another persons basic humanity. In essence, feelings of disrespect often come when we dwell on how others are different from ourselves. We can counteract these feelings by looking for ways we are similar. Without excusing others behavior, we try to sympathize, even empathize, with them. A rather clever person once hinted how to do this in the form of a prayerLord, help me forgive those who sin differently than I. When we recognize that we all have weaknesses, its easier to find a way to respect others. When we do this, we feel a kinship or mutuality between ourselves and even the thorniest of people. This sense of kinship and connection to others helps create Mutual Respect and eventually enables us to stay in dialogue with virtually anyone. Consider the following example. A manufacturing company had been out on strike for over six months. Finally, the union agreed to return to work, but the represented employees had to sign a contract that is actually worse than what they were originally demanding. On the first day back, it was clear that although people will work, they wont do so with a smile and a spring in their step. Everyone was furious. How were people ever going to move ahead? Concerned that although the strike was over, the battle wasnt, a manager asked one of the authors to lend a hand. So he met with the two groups of leaders (both managers and union heads) and asks them to do one thing. Each group was to go into a separate room and write out its goals for the company on flip-chart-sized paper. For two hours each group feverishly laid out what it wanted in the future and then taped the lists to the wall. When they finished their assignment, the groups then swapped places with the goal of finding anythingmaybe just a morselbut anything they might have in common. After a few minutes the two groups returned to the training room. They were positively stunned. It was as if they had written the exact same lists. They didnt merely share the shadow of an idea or two. Their aspirations were nearly identical. All wanted a profitable company, stable and rewarding jobs, high-quality products, and a positive impact on the community. Given a chance to speak freely and without fear of attack, each group laid out not simply what it wanted, but what virtually every person wanted. This experience caused members from each group to seriously question how they had judged the other side. They began to see others as more similar to themselves. They realized the petty and political tactics the others had used were embarrassingly similar to the ones they themselves had employed. The sins of others were different from their own more because of the role they played than because of a fundamental blight on their character. They restored Mutual Respect, and dialogue replaced silence and violence for the first time in decades. WHAT TO DO ONCE YOU STEP OUT When you see that either Mutual Respect or Purpose is at risk, weve suggested that you shouldnt ignore it. Weve also argued that you should be able to find a way to both find Mutual Purpose and enjoy Mutual Respecteven with people who are enormously different. But how? What are you supposed to actually do? Weve shared a few modest ideas (mostly things to avoid), so lets get into three hard-hitting skills that the best at dialogue use:  Apologize  Contrast  Create a Mutual Purpose Each skill helps rebuild either Mutual Respect or Mutual Purpose. First, well study them in action. Then, well see if they might help Yvonne get things back on track. Where were you ? Youre talking with a group of employees who worked all 
ight preparing for a VIP tour. You were supposed to bring the division vice president by, and the team members were then going to update her on a new process theyve put into place. Theyre proud of some improvements theyve recently madeenough so that they willingly worked straight through the night to finish the last details. Unfortunately, when it came time to swing by their area, the visiting VP dropped a bomb. She laid out a plan youre convinced would hurt quality and potentially drive away your biggest customers. Since you only had another hour with the VP, you chose to talk through the issue rather than conduct the tour. Your future depended on that particular conversation. Fortunately, you were able to revamp the original plan. Unfortunately, you forgot to get word to the team that had worked so hard. As you walked back to your office after escorting the executive to her car, you bumped into the team. Bleary-eyed and disappointed, all six of them were now fuming. No visit, no phone call, and now it was clear from the way you were sprinting passed them that you werent even going to stop and offer a simple explanation. Ouch. Thats when things started turning ugly. We pulled an all-nighter, and you didnt even bother to come by! Not even a text message to tell us something came up. Thanks. Time stands still. This conversation has just turned crucial. The employees who had worked so hard are obviously upset. They feel disrespected despite the fact that you werent trying to be disrespectful. But you fail to restore safety. Why? Because now you feel disrespected. Theyve attacked you. So you stay stuck in the content of the conversationthinking this has something to do with the factory tour. I had to choose between the future of the company and a facility tour. I chose our future, and Id do it again if I had to. Now both you and they are fighting for respect. This is getting you nowhere fast. But what else could you do? Instead of getting hooked and fighting back, break the cycle. See their aggressive behavior for what it isa sign of violated safetythen step out of the conversation, build safety, and step back into the content. Heres how. Apologize When Appropriate When youve made a mistake that has hurt others (e.g., you didnt call the team), start with an apology. An apology is a statement that sincerely expresses your sorrow for your role in causingor at least not preventingpain or difficulty to others. Im sorry I didnt give you a call when I learned that we wouldnt be coming by. You worked all night, it would have been a wonderful chance to showcase your improvements, and I didnt even explain what happened. I apologize.Now, an apology isnt really an apology unless you experience a change in heart. To offer a sincere apology, your motives have to change. You have to give up saving face, being right, or winning in order to focus on what you really want. You have to sacrifice a bit of your ego by admitting your error. But like many sacrifices, when you give up something you value, youre rewarded with something even more valuablehealthy dialogue and better results. Next, watch to see if this sincere show of respect has helped restore safety. If it has, you can now explain the details of what happened. If it hasnt, youll need to use one of the more advanced skills that follow in the next few pages. In any case, first make it safe; then return to the issue. Remember, when your behavior has given someone cause to doubt your respect or commitment to Mutual Purpose, your conversation is likely to end up in silly game playing and frustrating misunderstandings until you offer a sincere apology. Contrast to Fix Misunderstanding Sometimes others feel disrespected during crucial conversations even though you havent done anything disrespectful. Sure, there are times when respect gets violated because you behave in clearly hurtful ways. But just as often, the insult is entirely unintended. The same can happen with Mutual Purpose. You can start by innocently sharing your views, but the other people believe your intention is to harm them or coerce them into accepting your opinion. Clearly an apology is not appropriate in these circumstances. It would be disingenuous to admit you were wrong when you werent. How, then, can you rebuild Mutual Purpose or Mutual Respect in order to make it safe to get back to dialogue? When others misinterpret either your purpose or your intent, step out of the argument and rebuild safety by using a skill called Contrasting . Contrasting is a dont/do statement that:  Addresses others concerns that you dont respect them or that you have a malicious purpose (the dont part).  Confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose (the do part). For example: [The dont part] The last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I dont value the work you put in or that I didnt want to share it with the VP. [The do part] I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular. Now that youve addressed the threat to safety, you can return to the issue of the visit itself and move to remediation: Unfortunately, just when I was starting to make the trip out here, an issue came up with the VP that I needed to address right then and there, or it could have cost us a huge piece of our business. I tell you whatIll see if I can get her down here sometime tomorrow to review your work. Shell be here for the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Lets see if we can show off the process improvements you came up with. Of the two parts of Contrasting, the dont is the more important because it deals with the misunderstanding that has put safety at risk. The employees who worked so hard are acting on the belief that you dont appreciate their efforts and didnt care enough to keep them informedwhen the exact opposite was true. So you address the misunderstanding by explaining what you dont intend. Once youve done this, and safety returns to the conversation, then you can explain what you do intend. Safety first. Lets go back to Yvonne and Jotham. Yvonne is trying to get the conversation going, and Jotham suspects her motives. Lets see how Contrasting might help her. Y VONNE : I think it makes things worse when you withdraw and wont talk to me for days at a time. J OTHAM : So you expect me not only to put up with regular rejection, but also to be sociable and happy when I do? Jotham appears to believe that Yvonnes motive is to reshape him. Its unsafe. Mutual Purpose is at risk. Rather than responding to his sarcasm, Yvonne should step out of the content and clarify her real motives. Y VONNE : I dont want to suggest that this problem is yours. The truth is, I think its ours. Im not trying to put the burden on you. I dont even know what the solution is. What I do want is to be able to talk so that we can understand each other better. Perhaps that will help me change how Im responding to you, too. J OTHAM : I know where this is going. We talk, I continue to get rejected, but you get to feel good about yourself because weve communicated. Have you been reading your self-help library again? Obviously Jotham still believes that Yvonne merely wants to confirm that their existing relationship is okay and if she does, shell be able to continue to reject Jothambut feel good about it. Jotham still feels unsafe. So Yvonne continues to step out and build safety, using Contrasting. Y VONNE : Seriously, Honey. Im not interested in discussing why our current relationship is strong and healthy. I can see that it isnt. I merely want to talk about what each of us likes and doesnt like. That way well be able to see what we need to do in order to improve and why. My only goal is to come up with some ideas that will make both of us happy. J OTHAM : ( Changing tone and demeanor ) Really? Im sorry to be so insecure about this. I know Im being a bit selfish about things, but I dont know how to make myself feel differently. Contrasting is not apologizing . Its important to understand that Contrasting is not apologizing. It is not a way of taking back something weve said that hurt others feelings. Rather, it is a way of ensuring that what we said didnt hurt more than it should have. Once Yvonne clarified her genuine goals (and not merely some trumped-up goal that appeals to Jotham), Jotham felt safer acknowledging his own contribution, and the two were back in dialogue. Contrasting provides context and proportion . When youre in the middle of a touchy conversation, sometimes others experience your words as bigger or worse than you intend. For example, you talk with your assistant about his lack of punctuality. When you share your concern, he appears crushed. At this point, you could be tempted to water down your contentYou know its really not that big a deal. Dont give into the temptation. Dont take back what youve said. Instead, put your remarks in context. For instance, at this point your assistant may believe you are completely dissatisfied with his performance. He believes that your view of the issue at hand represents the totality of your respect for him. If this belief isincorrect, use Contrasting to clarify what you dont and do believe. Start with what you dont believe. Let me put this in perspective. I dont want you to think Im not satisfied with the quality of your work. I want us to continue working together. I really do think youre doing a good job. This punctuality issue is important to me, and Id just like you to work on that. If you will be more attentive to that, there are no other issues. Use Contrasting for prevention or first aid . Contrasting can be useful both as prevention and as first aid for safety problems. So far our examples have helped us apply first aid to a wounded conversation. Someone has taken something wrong, and weve intervened to clarify our true purpose or meaning. When were aware that something were about to drop into the pool of meaning could create a splash of defensiveness, we use Contrasting to bolster safetybefore we see others going to either silence or violence. I dont want you to think that I dont appreciate the time youve taken to keep our checkbook balanced and up to date. I do appreciate it, and I know I certainly couldnt have done nearly as well. I do, however, have some concerns with how were using the new electronic banking system. When people misunderstand and you start arguing over the misunderstanding, stop. Use Contrasting. Explain what you dont mean until youve restored safety. Then return to the conversation. Safety first. Create a Mutual Purpose Lets add one more skill. Sometimes we find ourselves in the middle of a debate because we clearly have different purposes. There is no misunderstanding here. Contrasting wont do the trick. We need something sturdier for this job. For instance, youve just been offered a promotion that will help propel your career along a faster track and bring you a great deal more authority, and it pays enough to help soften the blow of displacement. That last part is important because youll have to move the family across the country and your spouse and kids love where you currently live. You expected your spouse to have feelings of ambivalence over the move, but he or she doesnt seem to be bivaling even a tiny bit. To your spouse, the promotion is a bad news/bad news event. First, you have to move, and second, youll work even longer hours. That whole thing about more money and power doesnt seem to be compensating for the loss of time together. Now what? The worst at dialogue either ignore the problem and push ahead or roll over and let others have their way. They opt for either competition or submission. Both strategies end up making winners and losers, and the problem continues long beyond the initial conversation. The good at dialogue move immediately toward compromise. For example, the couple facing the transfer sets up two house-holdsone where the transferred spouse will be working and one where the family currently lives. Nobody really wants this arrangement, and frankly, its a pretty ugly solution thats bound to lead to more serious problems, even divorce. While compromise is sometimes necessary, the best know better than to start there. The best at dialogue use four skills to create a Mutual Purpose. If it helps you remember what to do, note that the four skills used in creating Mutual Purpose form the acronym CRIB. Commit to Seek Mutual Purpose As is true with most dialogue skills, if you want to get back to dialogue, you have to Start with Heart. In this case, you have to agree to agree . To besuccessful, we have to stop using silence or violence to compel others to our view. We must even surrender false dialogue, where we pretend to have Mutual Purpose (calmly arguing our side until the other person gives in). We Start with Heart by committing to stay in the conversation until we invent a solution that serves a purpose we both share. This can be tough. To stop arguing, we have to suspend our belief that our choice is the absolute best and only one, and that well never be happy until we get exactly what we currently want. We have to open our mind to the fact that maybe, just maybe, there is a third choice out thereone that suits everyone. We also have to be willing to verbalize this commitment even when our partner seems committed to winning. We act on faith that our partner is stuck in silence or violence because he or she feels unsafe. We assume that if we build more safetyby demonstrating our commitment to finding a Mutual Purposethe other person will feel more confident that dialogue could be a productive avenue. So next time you find yourself stuck in a battle of wills, try this amazingly powerful but simple skill. Step out of the content of the struggle and make it safe. Simply say, It seems like were both trying to force our view on each other. I commit to stay in this discussion until we have a solution that satisfies both of us. Then watch whether safety takes a turn for the better. Recognize the Purpose Behind the Strategy Wanting to come up with a shared goal is a wonderful first step, but desire alone is not enough. After weve experienced a change of heart, we need to change our strategy as well. Heres the problem we have to fix: When we find ourselves at an impasse, its because were asking for one thing and the other person is asking for something else. We think well never find a way out because we equate what were asking for with what we actually want. In truth, what were asking for is the strategy were suggesting to get what we want. We confuse wants or purpose with strategies. Thats the problem. For example, I come home from work and say that I want to go to a movie. You say that you want to stay home and relax. And so we debate: movie, TV, movie, read, etc. We figure well never be able to resolve our differences because going out and staying home are incompatible. In such circumstances, we can break the impasse by asking others, Why do you want that? In this case, Why do you want to stay home? Because Im tired of running around and dealing with the hassle of the city. So you want peace and quiet? Mostly. And why do you want to go to a movie? So I can spend some time with you away from the kids. Before you can agree on a Mutual Purpose, you must first know what peoples real purposes are. Step out of the content of the conversation which is generally focused on strategiesand explore the purposes behind them. When you do separate strategies from purpose, new options become possible. By releasing your grip on your strategy and focusing on your real purpose, youre now open to the idea that you might actually find alternatives that can serve both of your interests You want peace and quiet, and I want time with you away from the kids. So if we can come up with something that is quiet and away, well both be happy. Is that right? Absolutely. What if we were to take a drive up the canyon and . . . Invent a Mutual Purpose Sometimes when you recognize the purposes behind another persons strategies, you discover that you actually have compatible goals. From there you simply come up with common strategies. But youre not always so lucky. For example, you
find out that your genuine want BUT I COULD NEVER DO THAT! Reading a complicated interaction like this one might lead to two reactions. First, you might think, Wow, these ideas could actually work! And at the same time, you could be thinking, But theres no way I could think that clearly in the middle of that kind of delicate conversation! We admit that its pretty easy for us to put all the skills together when were sitting at a computer creating a script. But the good news is, thats not where these examples came from. They came from watching skilled people in action. People do act like this all the time. In fact, you do on your best days. So dont overwhelm yourself by insisting that you think and act this clearly and professionally during every heated and emotional conversation. Merely consider whether you could think a little more clearly during a few crucial conversations. Or prepare in advance. Before a crucial conversation begins, think about which skills will help you most. Remember, when it comes to these high-stakes conversations, a little progress can produce a lot of benefit. Finally, as is the case with most complicated problems, dont aim for perfection. Aim for progress. Learn to slow the process down when your adrenaline gets pumping. Carry a few of the questions were suggesting with you as you go. Pick the ones that you think are most relevant to the topic at hand. And watch yourself get better a little at a time. SUMMARYMAKE IT SAFE Step Out When others move to silence or violence, step out of the conversation and Make It Safe. When safety is restored, go back to the issue at hand and continue the dialogue. Decide Which Condition of Safety Is at Risk  Mutual Purpose . Do others believe you care about their goals in this conversation? Do they trust your motives?  Mutual Respect . Do others believe you respect them? Apologize When Appropriate  When youve clearly violated respect, apologize. Contrast to Fix Misunderstanding  When others misunderstand either your purpose or your intent, use Contrasting. Start with what you dont intend or mean. Then explain what you do intend or mean. Create a Mutual Purpose When you are at cross-purposes, use four skills to get back to Mutual Purpose:  C ommit to seek Mutual Purpose.  R ecognize the purpose behind the strategy.  I nvent a Mutual Purpose.  B rainstorm new strategies.",Crucial Conversations - Make It Safe: How to Make It Safe to Talk about Almost Anything,"When things go wrong in crucial conversations, we assume the content of our message is the problem, so we begin to water it down or avoid it altogether. But, as long as your intent is pure and you learn how to make it safe for others, you can talk to almost anyone about almost anything. The key is to make the other person feel safe. To do this, there are two things the person needs to know. First, they need to know that you care about their best interests and goals. This is called mutual purpose. Second, they need to know that you care about them. This is called mutual respect. When people believe both of these things, they relax and can absorb what youre saying; they feel safe. The instant they dont believe them (and it can happen instantaneously  even with those we have long and loving relationships with), safety breaks down and silence or violence follows. To restore safety in the face of silence or violence, you must restore mutual purpose and respect."
"This chapter explores how to gain control of crucial conversations by learning how to take charge of your emotions. By learning to exert influence over your own feelings, youll place yourself in a far better position to use all the tools weve explored thus far. HE MADE ME MAD! How many times have you heard someone say: He made me mad!? How many times have you said it? For instance, youre sitting quietly at home watching TV and your mother-in-law (who lives with you) walks in. She glances around and then starts picking up the mess you made a few minutes earlier when you whipped up a batch of nachos. This ticks you off. Shes always smugly skulking around the house, thinking youre a slob. A few minutes later when your spouse asks you why youre so upset, you explain, Its your mom again. I was lying here enjoying myself when she gave me that look, and it really got me going. To be honest, I wish she would quit doing that. Its my only day off, Im relaxing quietly, and then she walks in and pushes my buttons. Does she push your buttons? your spouse asks. Or do you? Thats an interesting question. One things for certain. No matter who is doing the button pushing, some people tend to react more explosively than othersand to the same stimulus, no less. Why is that? For instance, what enables some people to listen to withering feedback without flinching, whereas others pitch a fit when you tell them theyve got a smear of salsa on their chin? Why is it that sometimes you yourself can take a verbal blow to the gut without batting an eye, but other times you go ballistic if someone so much as looks at you sideways? EMOTIONS DONT JUST HAPPEN To answer these questions, well start with two rather bold (and sometimes unpopular) claims. Then, having tipped our hand, well explain the logic behind each claim. Claim one . Emotions dont settle upon you like a fog. They are not foisted upon you by others. No matter how comfortable it might make you feel saying itothers dont make you mad . You make you mad. You make you scared, annoyed, or insulted. You and only you create your emotions. Claim two . Once youve created your upset emotions, you have only two options: You can act on them or be acted on by them. That is, when it comes to strong emotions, you either find a way to master them or fall hostage to them. Heres how this all unfolds. MARIAS STORY Consider Maria, a copywriter who is currently being held hostage to some pretty strong emotions. She and her colleague Louis just reviewed the latest draft of a proposal with their boss. During the meeting, they were supposed to be jointly presenting their latest ideas. But when Maria paused to take a breath, Louis took over the presentation, making almost all the points they had come up with together. When the boss turned to Maria for input, there was nothing left for her to say. Maria has been feeling humiliated and angry throughout this project. First, Louis took their suggestions to the boss and discussed them behind her back. Second, he completely monopolized the presentation. Consequently, Maria believes that Louis is downplaying her contribution because shes the only woman on the team. Shes getting fed up with his boys club mentality. So what does she do? She doesnt want to appear oversensitive, so most of the time she says nothing and just does her job. However, she does manage to assert herself by occasionally getting in sarcastic jabs about the way shes being treated. Sure I can get that printout for you. Should I just get your coffee and whip up a bundt cake while Im at it? she mutters, and rolls her eyes as she exits the room. Louis, in turn, finds Marias cheap shots and sarcasm puzzling. Hes not sure what has Maria upset but is beginning to despise her smug attitude and hostile reaction to most everything he does. As a result, when the two work together, you could cut the tension with a knife. Whats Making Maria Mad? The worst at dialogue fall into the trap Maria has fallen into. Maria is completely unaware of a dangerous assumption shes making. Shes upset at being overlooked and is keeping a professional silence. Shes assuming that her emotions and behavior are the only right and reasonable reactions under the circumstances. Shes convinced that anyone in her place would feel the same way. Heres the problem. Maria is treating her emotions as if they are the only valid response. Since, in her mind, they are both justified and accurate, she makes no effort to change or even question them. Besides, in her view, Louis caused them. Ultimately, her actions (saying nothing and taking cheap shots) are being driven by these very emotions. Since shes not acting on her emotions, her emotions are acting on hercontrolling her behavior and fueling her deteriorating relationship with Louis. The worst at dialogue fall hostage to their emotions, and they dont even know it. The good at dialogue realize that if they dont control their emotions, matters will get worse. So they try something else. They fake it. They choke down reactions and then do their best to get back to dialogue. At least, they give it a shot. Unfortunately, once these emotionally choked folks hit a rough spot in a crucial conversation, their suppressed emotions come out of hiding. They show up as tightened jaws or sarcastic comments. Dialogue takes a hit. Or maybe their paralyzing fear causes them to avoid saying what they really think. Meaning is kept out of the pool because its cut off at the source. In any case, their emotions sneak out of the cubbyhole theyve been crammed into and find a way to creep into the conversation. Its never pretty, and it always kills dialogue. The best at dialogue do something completely different. They arent held hostage by their emotions, nor do they try to hide or suppress them. Instead, they act on their emotions. That is, when they have strong feelings, they influence (and often change) their emotions by thinking them out . As a result, they choose their emotions, and by so doing, make it possible to choose behaviors that create better results.This, of course, is easier said than done. Its not easy to rethink yourself from an emotional and dangerous state into one that puts you back in control. But it can be done. It should be done. Where should Maria start ? To help rethink or gain control of our emotions, lets see where our feelings come from in the first place. Lets look at a model that helps us first examine and then gain control of our own emotions. Consider Maria. Shes feeling hurt but is worried that if she says something to Louis, shell look too emotional, so she alternates between holding her feelings inside (avoiding) and taking cheap shots (masking). A s Figure 6-1 demonstrates, Marias actions stem from her feelings. First she feels and then she acts. Thats easy enough, but it begs the question: Whats causing Marias feelings in the first place? Is it Louiss behavior? As was the case with the nacho-mother-in-law, did Louis make Maria feel insulted and hurt? Maria heard and saw Louis do something, she generated an emotion, and then she acted out her feelingsusing forms of masking and avoiding. So heres the big question: What happens between Louis acting and Maria feeling? Is there an intermediate step that turns someone elses actions into our feelings? If not, then it has to be true that others make us feel the way we do. Stories Create Feelings As it turns out, there is an intermediate step between what others do and how we feel. Theres always an intermediate step because actions themselves cant and dont cause emotional reactions. Thats why, when faced with the exact same circumstances, ten people may have ten different emotional responses. For instance, with a coworker like Louis, some might feel insulted whereas others merely feel curious. Some become angry and others feel concern or even sympathy. What is this intermediate step? Just after we observe what others do and just before we feel some emotion about it, we tell ourselves a story. We add meaning to the action we observed. We make a guess at the motive driving the behavior. Why were they doing that? We also add judgment is that good or bad? And then, based on these thoughts or stories, our body responds with an emotion. Pictorially it looks like the model in Figure 6-2. We call this model our Path to Action because it explains how emotions, thoughts, and experiences lead to our actions. Youll note that weve added telling a story to our model. We observe, we tell a story , and then we feel. Although this addition complicates the model a bit, it also gives us hope. Since we and only we are telling the story, we can take back control of our own emotions by telling a different story. We now have a point of leverage or control. If we can find a way to control the stories we tell, by rethinking or retelling them, we can master our emotions and, therefore, master our crucial conversations. OUR STORIES Nothing in this world is good or bad, but thinking makes it so . W ILLIAM S HAKESPEARE Stories provide our rationale for whats going on . Theyre our interpretations of the facts. They help explain what we see and hear. Theyre theories we use to explain why, how , and what . For instance, Maria asks: Why does Louis take over? He doesnt trust my ability to communicate. He thinks that because Im a woman, people wont listen to me. Our stories also help explain how. How am I supposed to judge all of this? Is this a good or a bad thing? Louis thinks Im incompetent, and this is bad. Finally, a story might also include what . What should I do about all this? If I say something, hell think Im a whiner or oversensitive or militant, so its best to clam up.Of course, as we come up with our own meaning or stories, it isnt long until our body responds with strong feelings or emotionsafter all, our emotions are directly linked to our judgments of right/wrong, good/bad, kind/selfish, fair/unfair, etc. Marias story yields anger and frustration. These feelings, in turn, drive Maria to her actionstoggling back and forth between clamming up and taking an occasional cheap shot (see Figure 6-3). Even if you dont realize it, you are telling yourself stories . When we teach people that its our stories that drive our emotions and not other peoples actions, someone inevitably raises a hand and says, Wait a minute! I didnt notice myself telling a story. When that guy laughed at me during my presentation, I just felt angry. The feelings came first; the thoughts came second. Storytelling typically happens blindingly fast. When we believe were at risk, we tell ourselves a story so quickly that we dont even know were doing it. If you dont believe this is true, ask yourself whether you always become angry when someone laughs at you. If sometimes you do and sometimes you dont, then your response isnt hard-wired. That means something goes on between others laughing and you feeling. In truth, you tell a story. You may not remember it, but you tell a story. Any set of facts can be used to tell an infinite number of stories . Stories are just that, stories. These explanations could be told in any of thousands of different ways. For instance, Maria could just as easily have decided that Louis didnt realize she cared so much about the project. She could have concluded that Louis was feeling unimportant and this was a way of showing he was valuable. Or maybe he had been burned in the past because he hadnt personally seen through every detail of a project. Any of these stories would have fit the facts and would have created very different emotions. If we take control of our stories, they wont control us . People who excel at dialogue are able to influence their emotions during crucial conversations. They recognize that while its true that at first we are in control of the stories we tellafter all, we do make them up of our own accord once theyre told, the stories control us . They first control how we feel and then how we act. And as a result, they control the results we get from our crucial conversations. But it doesnt have to be this way. We can tell different stories and break the loop. In fact, until we tell different stories, we cannot break the loop. If you want improved results from your crucial conversations, change the stories you tell yourselfeven while youre in the middle of the fray. SKILLS FOR MASTERING OUR STORIES Whats the most effective way to come up with different stories? The best at dialogue find a way to first slow down and then take charge of their Path to Action. Heres how. Retrace Your Path To slow down the lightning-quick storytelling process and the subsequent flow of adrenaline, retrace your Path to Actionone element at a time. This calls for a bit of mental gymnastics. First you have to stop what youre currently doing. Then you have to get in touch with why youre doing it. Heres how to retrace your path:  [ Act ] Notice your behavior. Ask: Am I in some form of silence or violence?  [ Feel ] Get in touch with your feelings. What emotions are encouraging me to act this way?  [ Tell story ] Analyze your stories. What story is creating these emotions?  [ See/hear ] Get back to the facts. What evidence do I have to support this story? By retracing your path one element at a time, you put yourself in a position to think about, question, and change any one or more of the elements. Notice Your Behavior Why would you stop and retrace your Path to Action in the first place? Certainly if youre constantly stopping what youre doing and looking for your underlying motive and thoughts, you wont even be able to put on your shoes without thinking about it for who knows how long. Youll die of analysis paralysis. Actually, you shouldnt constantly stop and question your actions. If you Learn to Look (as we suggested in Chapter 4) and note that you yourself are slipping into silence or violence, you have good reason to stop and take stock. But looking isnt enough. You must take an honest look at what youre doing. If you tell yourself a story that your violent behavior is a necessary tactic, you wont see the need to reconsider your actions. If you immediately jump in with they started it, or otherwise find yourself rationalizingyour behavior, you also wont feel compelled to change. Rather than stop and review what youre doing, youll devote your time to justifying your actions to yourself and others. When an unhelpful story is driving you to silence or violence, stop and consider how others would see your actions. For example, if the 60 Minutes camera crew replayed this scene on national television, how would you look? What would they tell about your behavior? Not only do those who are best at crucial conversations notice when theyre slipping into silence or violence, but theyre also able to admit it. They dont wallow in self-doubt, of course, but they do recognize the problem and begin to take corrective action. The moment they realize that theyre killing dialogue, they review their own Path to Action. Get In Touch with Your Feelings As skilled individuals begin to retrace their own Path to Action, they immediately move from examining their own unhealthy behavior to exploring their feelings or emotions. At first glance this task sounds easy. Im angry! you think to yourself. What could be easier? Actually, identifying your emotions is more difficult than you might imagine. In fact, many people are emotionally illiterate. When asked to describe how theyre feeling, they use words such as bad or angry or frightenedwhich would be okay if these were accurate descriptors, but often theyre not. Individuals say theyre angry when, in fact, theyre feeling a mix of embarrassment and surprise. Or they suggest theyre unhappy when theyre feeling violated. Perhaps they suggest theyre upset when theyre really feeling humiliated and cheated. Since life doesnt consist of a series of vocabulary tests, you might wonder what difference words can make. But words do matter. Knowing what youre really feeling helps you take a more accurate look at what is going on and why. For instance, youre far more likely to take an honest look at the story youre telling you
self if you admit youre feeling both embarrassed and surprised rather than simply angry. How about you? When experiencing strong emotions, do you stop and think about your feelings? If so, do you use a rich vocabulary, or do you mostly draw from terms such as bummed out and furious? Second, do you talk openly with others about how you feel? Do you willingly talk with loved ones about whats going on inside of you? Third, in so doing, is your vocabulary robust and accurate? Its important to get in touch with your feelings, and to do so, you may want to expand your emotional vocabulary. Analyze Your Stories Question your feelings and stories . Once youve identified what youre feeling, you have to stop and ask, given the circumstances, is it the right feeling? Meaning, of course, are you telling the right story? After all, feelings come from stories, and stories are our own invention. The first step to regaining emotional control is to challenge the illusion that what youre feeling is the only right emotion under the circumstances. This may be the hardest step, but its also the most important one. By questioning our feelings, we open ourselves up to question our stories. We challenge the comfortable conclusion that our story is right and true. We willingly question whether our emotions (very real), and the story behind them (only one of many possible explanations), are accurate. For instance, what were the facts in Marias story? She saw Louis give the whole presentation. She heard the boss talk about meeting with Louis to discuss the project when she wasnt present. That was the beginning of Marias Path to Action. Dont confuse stories with facts . Sometimes you fail to question your stories because you see them as immutable facts. When you generate stories in the blink of an eye, you can get so caught up in the moment that you begin to believe your stories are facts. They feel like facts. You confuse subjective conclusions with steel-hard data points. For example, in trying to ferret out facts from story, Maria might say, Hes a male chauvinist pigthats a fact! Ask anyone who has seen how he treats me! Hes a male chauvinist pig is not a fact. Its the story that Maria created to give meaning to the facts. The facts could mean just about anything. As we said earlier, others could watch Marias interactions with Louis and walk away with different stories. Get Back to the Facts Separate fact from story by focusing on behavior . To separate fact from story, get back to the genuine source of your feelings. Test your ideas against a simple criterion: Can you see or hear this thing youre calling a fact? Was it an actual behavior? For example, it is a fact that Louis gave 95 percent of the presentation and answered all but one question. This is specific, objective, and verifiable. Any two people watching the meeting would make the same observation. However, the statement He doesnt trust me is a conclusion. It explains what you think , not what the other person did . Conclusions are subjective. Spot the story by watching for hot words . Heres another tip. To avoid confusing story with fact, watch for hot terms. For example, when assessing the facts, you might say, She scowled at me or He made a sarcastic comment. Words such as scowl and sarcastic are hot terms. They express judgments and attributions that, in turn, create strong emotions. They are story, not fact. Notice how much different it is when you say, Her eyes pinched shut and her lips tightened, as opposed to, She scowled at me. In Marias case, she suggested that Louis was controlling and didnt respect her. Had she focused on his behavior (he talked a lot and met with the boss one-on-one), this less volatile description would have allowed for any number of interpretations. For example, perhaps Louis was nervous, concerned, or unsure of himself. Watch for Three Clever Stories As we begin to piece together why people are doing what theyre doing (or equally important, why were doing what were doing), with time and experience we become quite good at coming up with explanations that serve us well. Either our stories are completely accurate and propel us in healthy directions, or theyre quite inaccurate but justify our current behaviormaking us feel good about ourselves and calling for no need to change. Its the second kind of story that routinely gets us into trouble. For example, we move to silence or violence, and then we come up with a perfectly plausible reason for why its okay. Of course I yelled at him. Did you see what he did? He deserved it. Hey, dont be giving me the evil eye. I had no other choice. We call these imaginative and self-serving concoctions clever stories. Theyre clever because they allow us to feel good about behaving badly. Better yet, they allow us to feel good about behaving badly even while achieving abysmal results. When we feel a need to justify our ineffective behavior or disconnect ourselves from our bad results, we tend to tell our stories in three very predictable ways. Learn what the three are and how to counteract them, and you can take control of your emotional life. Fail to do so and youll be a victim to the emotions youre predisposed to have wash over you at crucial times.Victim StoriesIts Not My Fault The first of the clever stories is a Victim Story. Victim Stories, as you might imagine, make us out to be innocent sufferers. The theme is always the same. The other person is bad, wrong, or dumb, and we are good, right, or brilliant. Other people do bad or stupid things, and we suffer as a result. In truth, there is such a thing as an innocent victim. Youre stopped in the street and held up at gunpoint. When an event such as this occurs, its a sad fact, not a story. You are a victim. But all tales of victimization are not so clear-cut and one-sided. Within most crucial conversations, when you tell a Victim Story, you intentionally ignore the role you have played in the problem. You tell your story in a way that judiciously avoids whatever you have done (or neglected to do) that might have contributed to the problem. For instance, last week your boss took you off a big project, and it hurt your feelings. You complained to everyone about how bad you felt. Of course, you failed to let your boss know that you were behind on an important project, leaving him high and dry which is why he removed you in the first place. This part of the story you leave out because, hey, he made you feel bad. To help support your Victim Stories you speak of nothing but your noble motives. I took longer because I was trying to beat the standard specs. Then you tell yourself that youre being punished for your virtues, not your vices. He just doesnt appreciate a person with my superb attention to detail. (This added twist turns you from victim into martyr. What a bonus!) Villain StoriesIts All Your Fault We create these nasty little tales by turning normal, decent human beings into villains. We impute bad motive, and then we tell everyone about the evils of the other party as if somehow were doing the world a huge favor. For example, we describe a boss who is zealous about quality as a control freak. When our spouse is upset that we didnt keep a commitment, we see him or her as inflexible and stubborn. In Victim Stories we exaggerate our own innocence. In Villain Stories we overemphasize the other persons guilt or stupidity. We automatically assume the worst possible motives or grossest incompetence while ignoring any possible good or neutral intentions or skills a person may have. Labeling is a common device in Villain Stories. For example, I cant believe that bonehead gave me bad materials again. By employing the handy label, we are now dealing not with a complex human being, but with a bonehead. Not only do Villain Stories help us blame others for bad results, but they also set us up to then do whatever we want to the villains. After all, we can feel okay insulting or abusing a bonehead whereas we might have to be more careful with a living, breathing person. Then when we fail to get the results we really want, we stay stuck in our ineffective behavior because, after all, look who were dealing with! Watch for the double standard . When you pay attention to Victim and Villain Stories and catch them for what they are unfair caricaturesyou begin to see the terrible double standard we use when our emotions are out of control. When we make mistakes, we tell a Victim Story by claiming our intentions were innocent and pure. Sure I was late getting home and didnt call you, but I couldnt let the team down! On the other hand, when others do things that hurt or inconvenience us, we tell Villain Stories in which we invent terrible motives or exaggerate flaws for others based on how their actions affected us. You are so thoughtless! You could have called me and told me you were going to be late. Helpless StoriesTheres Nothing Else I Can Do Finally come Helpless Stories. In these fabrications we make ourselves out to be powerless to do anything healthy or helpful. We convince ourselves that there are no healthy alternatives for dealing with our predicament, which justifies the action were about to take. A Helpless Story might suggest, If I didnt yell at my son, he wouldnt listen. Or on the flip side, If I told the boss this, he would just be defensiveso of course I say nothing! While Villian and Victim Stories look back to explain why were in the situation were in, Helpless Stories look forward to explain why we cant do anything to change our situation. Its particularly easy to act helpless when we turn others behavior into fixed and unchangeable traits. For example, when we decide our colleague is a control freak (Villain Story), we are less inclined to give her feedback because, after all, control freaks like her dont accept feedback (Helpless Story). Nothing we can do will change that fact. As you can see, Helpless Stories often stem from Villain Stories and typically offer us nothing more than Fools Choices we can either be honest and ruin the relationship or stay silent and suffer. Why We Tell Clever Stories Of course, theres a story behind our stories. They dont just randomly roll out of our mouths. They serve four important masters. Clever stories match reality . Sometimes the stories we tell are accurate. The other person is trying to cause us harm, we are innocent victims, or maybe we really cant do much about the problem. It can happen. Its not common, but it can happen. Clever stories get us off the hook . More often than not, our conclusions transform from reasonable explanations to clever stories when they conveniently excuse us from any responsibilitywhen, in reality, we have been partially responsible. The other person isnt bad and wrong, and we arent right and good. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. However, if we can make others out as wrong and ourselves out as right, were off the hook. Better yet, once weve demonized others, we can even insult and abuse them if we want. Clever stories keep us from acknowledging our own sellouts . By now it should be clear that clever stories cause us problems. A reasonable question at this point is, If theyre so terribly hurtful, why do we ever tell clever stories? Our need to tell clever stories often starts with our own sellouts. Like it or not, we usually dont begin telling stories that justify our actions until we have done something that we feel a need to justify. 1 We sell out when we consciously act against our own sense of whats right. And after weve sold out, we have only two choices: own up to our sellout, or try to justify it. And if we dont admit to our errors, we inevitably look for ways to justify them. Thats when we begin to tell clever stories. Lets look at an example of a sellout: Youre driving in heavy traffic. You begin to pass cars that are attempting to merge into your lane. A car very near you has accelerated and is entering your lane. A thought strikes you that you should let him in. Its the nice thing to do, and youd want someone to let you in. But you dont. You accelerate forward and close the gap. What happens next? You begin to have thoughts like these: He cant just crowd in on me. What a jerk! Ive been fighting this traffic a long time. Besides, Ive got an important appointment to get to. And so on. This story makes you the innocent victim and the other person the nasty villain. Under the influence of this story you now feel justified in not doingwhat you originally thought you should have done. You also ignore what you would think of others who did the same thingThat jerk didnt let me in! Consider an example more related to crucial conversations. Your spouse has an annoying habit. Its not a big deal, but you feel you should mention it. But you dont. Instead, you just huff or roll your eyes, hoping that will send the message. Unfortunately, your spouse doesnt pick up the hint and continues the habit. Your annoyance turns to resentment. You feel disgusted that your spouse is so thick that he or she cant pick up an obvious hint. And besides, you shouldnt have to mention this anywayany reasonable person should notice this on his or her own! Do you have to point out everything ? From this point forward you begin to make insulting wisecracks about the issue until it escalates into an ugly confrontation. Notice the order of the events in both of these examples. What came first, the story or the sellout? Did you convince yourself of the other drivers selfishness and then not let him in? Of course not. You had no reason to think he was selfish until you needed an excuse for your own selfish behavior. You didnt start telling clever stories until after you failed to do something you knew you should have done. Your spouses annoying habit didnt become a source of resentment until you became part of the problem. You got upset because you sold out. And the clever story helped you feel good about being rude. Sellouts are often not big events. In fact, they can be so small that theyre easy for us to overlook when were crafting our clever stories. Here are some common ones:  You believe you should help someone, but dont.  You believe you should apologize, but dont.  You believe you should stay late to finish up on a commitment, but go home instead.  You say yes when you know you should say no, then hope no one follows up to see if you keep your commitment.  You believe you should talk to someone about concerns you have with him or her, but dont.  You do less than your share and think you should acknowledge it, but say nothing knowing no one else will bring it up either.  You believe you should listen respectfully to feedback, but become defensive instead.  You see problems with a plan someone presents and think you should speak up, but dont.  You fail to complete an assignment on time and believe you should let others know, but dont.  You know you have information a coworker could use, but keep it to yourself. Even small sellouts like these get us started telling clever stories. When we dont admit to our own mistakes, we obsess about others faults, our innocence, and our powerlessness to do anything other than what were already doing. We tell a clever story when we want self-justification more than results. Of course, self-justification is not what we really want, but we certainly act as if it is. With that sad fact in mind, lets focus on what we really want. Lets look at the final Master My Stories skill. Tell the Rest of the Story Once weve learned to recognize the clever stories we tell ourselves, we can move to the final Master My Stories skill. The dialogue-smart recognize that theyre telling clever stories, stop, and then do what it takes to tell a useful story. A useful story, by definition, creates emotions that lead to healthy actionsuch as dialogue. And what transforms a clever story into a useful one? The rest of the story. Thats because clever stories have one characteristic in common: Theyre incomplete. Clever stories omit crucial information about us, about others, and about our options. Only by including all of these essential details can cl

","Crucial Conversations - Master My Stories: How to Stay in Dialogue When Youre Angry, Scared, or Hurt","When we become upset, our most common reaction is to defend ourselves and place the blame on someone else. As convenient as it is to blame others for pushing our buttons and causing us to become upset, its not exactly true. The key to how we feel lies in the stories we tell. These stories consist of our guess as to why people do what they do. As we become emotional, our story seems to be What is the worst and most hurtful way I can take this? This negative spin escalates our emotions and causes us to do the worst when it matters the most. To break away from your volatile emotions, you must rethink the conclusions you drew and the judgments you made. That requires you to tell the rest of the story. New (more accurate and complete) stories create new feelings and support new and healthier actions. Better still, new stories often encourage you to return to dialogue."
"So far weve gone to great pains to prepare ourselves to step up to and master crucial conversations. Heres what weve learned. Our hearts need to be in the right place. We need to pay close attention to crucial conversationsparticularly when people start feeling unsafeand restore safety when necessary. And heaven forbid that we should tell ourselves clever and unhelpful stories. So lets say that we are well prepared. Were ready to open our mouths and start sharing our point of view. Thats right, were actually going to express our opinion. Now what? Most of the time, we walk into a discussion and slide into autopilot. Hi, how are the kids? Whats going on at work? What could be easier than talking? We know thousands of words and generally weave them into sentences that suit our needs. Most of the time. However, when stakes rise and our emotions kick in, well, thats when we open our mouths and dont do so well. In fact, as we suggested earlier, the more important the discussion, the less likely we are to be on our best behavior. More specifically, we advocate or express our views quite poorly. To help us improve our advocacy skills, well examine two challenging situations. First, well look at five skills for talking when what we have to say could easily make others defensive. Second, well explore how these same skills help us state our opinions when we believe so strongly in something that we risk shutting others down rather than opening them up to our ideas. SHARE RISKY MEANING Adding information to the pool of meaning can be quite difficult when the ideas were about to pour into the collective consciousness contain delicate, unattractive, or controversial opinions. Im sorry, Marta, but people simply dont like working with you. Youve been asked to leave the special-projects team. Its one thing to argue that your company needs to shift from green to red packaging; its quite another to tell a person that he or she is offensive or unlikable. When the topic turns from things to people, its always more difficult, and to nobodys surprise, some people are better at it than others. When it comes to sharing touchy information, the worst alternate between bluntly dumping their ideas into the pool of meaning and saying nothing at all. Either they start with, Youre not going to like this, but, hey, somebody has to be honest . . . (a classic Fools Choice), or they simply stay mum. Fearful they could easily destroy a healthy relationship, those who are good at dialogue say some of whats on their minds, but they understate their views out of fear of hurting others. They talk all right, but they carefully sugarcoat their message. The best at dialogue speak their minds completely and do it in a way that makes it safe for others to hear what they have to say and respond to it as well. They are both totally frank and completely respectful. MAINTAIN SAFETY In order to speak honestly when honesty could easily offend others, we have to find a way to maintain safety. Thats a bit like telling someone to smash another person in the nose, but, you know, dont hurt him. How can we speak the unspeakable and still maintain respect? Actually, it can be done if you know how to carefully blend three ingredientsconfidence, humility, and skill. Confidence . Most people simply wont hold delicate conversationswell, at least not with the right person. For instance, your colleague Brian goes home at night and tells his wife that his boss, Fernando, is micromanaging him to within an inch of his life. He says the same thing over lunch when talking with his pals. Everyone knows what Brian thinks about Fernandoexcept, of course, Fernando. People who are skilled at dialogue have the confidence to say what needs to be said to the person who needs to hear it. They are confident that their opinions deserve to be placed in the pool of meaning. They are also confident that they can speak openly without brutalizing others or causing undue offense. Humility . Confidence does not equate to arrogance or pigheadedness. Skilled people are confident that they have something to say, but also realize that others have valuable input. They are humble enough to realize that they dont have a monopoly on the truth nor do they always have to win their way. Their opinions provide a starting point but not the final word. They may currently believe something but realize that with new information they may change their minds. This means theyre willing to both express their opinions and encourage others to do the same. Skill . Finally, people who willingly share delicate information are good at doing it. Thats why theyre confident in the first place. They dont make a Fools Choice, because theyve found a path that allows for both candor and safety. They speak the unspeakable, and people are grateful for their honesty. Good Night and Good-Bye! To see how to discuss sensitive issues, lets look at an enormously difficult problem. Bob has just walked in the door, and his wife, Carole, looks upset. He can tell from her swollen eyes that shes been crying. Only when he walks in the door, Carole doesnt turn to him for comfort. Instead, she looks at him with an expression that says, How could you? Bob doesnt know it yet, but Carole thinks hes having an affair. Hes not. How did Carole come to this dangerous and wrong conclusion? Earlier that day she had been going over the credit card statement when she noticed a charge from the Good Night Motela cheap place located not more than a mile from their home. Why would he stay in a motel so close to home? she wonders. And why didnt I know about it? Then it hits herThat unfaithful jerk! Now whats the worst way Carole might handle this (one that doesnt involve packing up and moving back to Australia)? Whats the worst way of talking about the problem? Most people agree that jumping in with an ugly accusation followed by a threat is a good candidate for that distinction. Its also what most people do, and Carole is no exception.I cant believe youre doing this to me, she says in a painful tone. Doing what? Bob asksnot knowing what shes talking about, but figuring that whatever it is, it cant be good. You know what Im talking about, she says, continuing to keep Bob on edge. Do I need to apologize for missing her birthday? Bob wonders to himself. No, its not even summer and her birthday is on . . . well, its sweltering on her birthday. Im sorry, I dont know what youre talking about, he responds, taken aback. Youre having an affair, and I have proof right here! Carole explains holding up a piece of crumpled paper. Whats on that paper that says Im having an affair? he asks, completely befuddled because (1) hes not having an affair, and (2) the paper contains not a single compromising photo. Its a motel bill, you jerk. You take some woman to a motel, and you put it on the credit card?! I cant believe youre doing this to me! Now if Carole were certain that Bob was having an affair, perhaps this kind of talk would be warranted. It may not be the best way to work through the issue, but Bob would at least understand why Carole made the accusations and hurled threats. But, in truth, she only has a piece of paper with some numbers on it. This tangible piece of evidence has made her suspicious. How should she talk about this nasty hunch in a way that leads to dialogue? STATE MY PATH If Caroles goal is to have a healthy conversation about a tough topic (e.g., I think youre having an affair), her only hope is to stay in dialogueat least until she confirms or disconfirms her concerns. That holds true for anybody with any crucial conversation (i.e., It feels like you micromanage me; I fear youre using drugs). That means that despite your worst suspicions, you shouldnt violate respect. In a similar vein, you shouldnt kill safety with threats and accusations. So what should you do? Start with Heart. Think about what you really want and how dialogue can help you get it. And master your storyrealize that you may be jumping to a hasty Victim, Villain, or Helpless Story. The best way to find out the true story is not to act out the worst story you can generate. That will lead to self-destructive silence and violence games. Think about other possible explanations long enough to temper your emotions so you can get to dialogue. Besides, if it turns out youre right about your initial impression, there will be plenty of time for confrontations later on. Once youve worked on yourself to create the right conditions for dialogue, you can then draw upon five distinct skills that can help you talk about even the most sensitive topics. These five tools can be easily remembered with the acronym STATE. It stands for:  Share your facts  Tell your story  Ask for others paths  Talk tentatively  Encourage testing The first three skills describe what to do. The last two tell how to do it. THE WHAT SKILLS Share Your Facts In the last chapter we suggested that if you retrace your Path to Action to the source, you eventually arrive at the facts. For example, Carole found the credit card invoice. Thats a fact. She then told a storyBobs having an affair. Next, she felt betrayed and horrified. Finally, she attacked Bob I should never have married you! The whole interaction was fast, predictable, and very ugly. What if Carole took a different routeone that started with facts? What if she were able to suspend the ugly story she told herself (by intentionally thinking of alternative plausible stories) and then start her conversation with the facts? Wouldnt that be a safer way to go? Maybe, she muses, there is a good reason behind all of this. Why dont I start with the suspicious bill and then go from there? If she started there, shed be right. The best way to share your view is to follow your Path to Action from beginning to endthe same way you traveled it (Figure 7-1). Unfortunately, when were drunk on adrenaline, our tendency is to do precisely the opposite. Since were obsessing on our emotions and stories, thats what we start with. Of course, starting with our ugly stories is the most controversial, least influential, and most insulting way we could begin. To make matters worse, this strategy creates still another self-fulfilling prophecy. Were so anxious to blurt out our unflattering conclusions that we say things in extremely ineffective ways. Then, when we get bad results (and we are going to get bad results), we tell ourselves that we just cant share risky views without creating problems. So the next time weve got something sticky to say, were even more reluctant to say it. We hold it inside where the story builds up steam, and when we do eventually share our horrific story, we do so with a vengeance. The cycle starts all over again.Facts are the least controversial . Facts provide a safe beginning. By their very nature, facts arent controversial. Thats why we call them facts. For example, consider the statement: Yesterday you arrived at work twenty minutes late. No dispute there. Conclusions, on the other hand, are highly controversial. For example: You cant be trusted. Thats hardly a fact. Actually, its more like an insult, and it can certainly be disputed. Eventually we may want to share our conclusions, but we certainly dont want to open up with a controversy. Facts are the most persuasive . In addition to being less controversial, facts are also more persuasive than subjective conclusions. Facts form the foundation of belief. So if you want to persuade others, dont start with your stories. Start with your observations. For example, which of the following do you find more persuasive? I want you to stop sexually harassing me! or When you talk to me, your eyes move up and down rather than look at my face. And sometimes you put your hand on my shoulder. While were speaking here about being persuasive, lets add that our goal is not to persuade others that we are right . We arent trying to win the dialogue. We just want our meaning to be added to the pool to get a fair hearing. Were trying to help others see how a reasonable, rational, and decent person could end up with the story were carrying. Thats all. When we start with shocking or offensive conclusions (Quit groping me with your eyes! or I think we should declare bankruptcy), we actually encourage others to tell Villain Stories about us. Since weve given them no facts to support our conclusion, they make up reasons were saying these things. Theyre likely to believe were either stupid or evil. So if your goal is to help others see how a reasonable, rational, and decent person could think what youre thinking, start with your facts. And if you arent sure what your facts are (your story is absolutely filling your brain), take the time to think them through before you enter the crucial conversation. Take the time to sort out facts from conclusions. Gathering the facts is the homework required for crucial conversations. Facts are the least insulting . If you do want to share your story, dont start with it. Your story (particularly if it has led to a rather ugly conclusion) could easily surprise and insult others. It could kill safety in one rash, ill-conceived sentence. B RIAN : Id like to talk to you about your leadership style. You micromanage me, and its starting to drive me nuts. F ERNANDO : What? I ask you if youre going to be done on time and you lay into me with . . . If you start with your story (and in so doing, kill safety), you may never actually get to the facts. Begin your path with facts . In order to talk about your stories, you need to lead the others involved down your Path to Action. Let them experience your path from the beginning to the end, and not from the end towell, to wherever it takes you. Let others see your experience from your point of viewstarting with your facts. This way, when you do talk about what youre starting to conclude, theyll understand why. First the facts, then the storyand then make sure that as you explain your story, you tell it as a possible story, not as concrete fact. Ask for Others Paths We mentioned that the key to sharing sensitive ideas is a blend of confidence and humility. We express our confidence by sharing our facts and stories clearly. We demonstrate our humility by then asking others to share their viewsand meaning it. So once youve shared your point of viewfacts and stories alikeinvite others to do the same. If your goal is to keep expanding the pool of meaning rather than to be right, to make the best decision rather than to get your way, then youll willingly listen to other views. By being open to learning we are demonstrating humility at its best. For example, ask yourself: What does the schoolteacher think? Is my boss really intending to micromanage me? Is my spouse really having an affair? To find out others views on the matter, encourage them to express their facts, stories, and feelings. Then carefully listen to what they have to say. Equally important, be willing to abandon or reshape your story as more information pours into the Pool of Shared Meaning. THE HOW SKILLS Talk Tentatively If you look back at the vignettes weve shared so far, youll note that we were careful to describe both facts and stories in a tentative, or nondogmatic, way. For example, I was wondering why . . . Talking tentatively simply means that we tell our story as a story rather than disguising it as a hard fact. Perhaps you were unaware . . . suggests that youre not absolutely certain. In my opinion . . . says youre sharing an opinion and no more. When sharing a story, strike a blend between confidence and humility. Share in a way that expresses appropriate confidence in your conclusions while demonstrating that, if called for, you want your conclusions challenged. To do so, change The fact is to In my opinion. Swap Everyone knows that for Ive talked to three of our suppliers who think that. Soften Its clear to me to Im beginning to wonder if. Why soften the message? Because were trying to add meaning to the pool, not force it down other peoples throats. If were too forceful, the information wont make it into the pool. One of 
he ironies of dialogue is that, when talking with those holding opposing opinions, the more convinced and forceful you act, the more resistant others become. Speaking in absolute and overstated terms does not increase your influence, it decreases it. The converse is also truethe more tentatively you speak, the more open people become to your opinions. Now, this raises an interesting question. Individuals have asked us if being tentative is akin to being manipulative. Youre pretending to be uncertain about your opinion in order to help others consider it less defensively. Our answer to this is an unequivocal no . If you are faking tentativeness, you are not in dialogue. The reason we should speak tentatively is because we, indeed, are not certain that our opinions represent absolute truth or our understanding of the facts is complete and perfect. You should never pretend to be less confident than you are. But likewise, you should not pretend to be more confident than your limited capacity allows. Our observations could be faulty. Our storieswell, theyre only educated guesses. Tentative, not wimpy . Some people are so worried about being too forceful or pushy that they err in the other direction. They wimp out by making still another Fools Choice. They figure that the only safe way to share touchy data is to act as if its not important. I know this is probably not true . . . or Call me crazy but . . . When you begin with a complete disclaimer and do it in a tone that suggests youre consumed with doubt, you do the message a disservice. Its one thing to be humble and open. Its quite another to be clinically uncertain. Use language that says youre sharing an opinion, not language that says youre a nervous wreck. Encourage Testing When you ask others to share their paths, how you phrase your invitation makes a big difference. Not only should you invite others to talk, but you have to do so in a way that makes it clear that no matter how controversial their ideas might be, you want to hear them. Others need to feel safe sharing their observations and storiesparticularly if they differ from yours. Otherwise, they dont speak up and you cant test the accuracy and relevance of your views. Safety becomes particularly important when youre having a crucial conversation with people who might move to silence. Some people make Fools Choices in these circumstances. They worry that if they share their true opinions, others will clam up. So they choose between speaking their minds and hearing others out. But the best at dialogue dont choose. They do both. They understand that the only limit to how strongly you can express your opinion is your willingness to be equally vigorous in encouraging others to challenge it. Invite opposing views . So if you think others may be hesitant, make it clear that you want to hear their viewsno matter how different. If others disagree, so much the better. If what they have to say is controversial or even touchy, respect them for finding the courage to express what theyre thinking. If they have different facts or stories, you need to hear them to help complete the picture. Make sure they have the opportunity to share by actively inviting them to do so: Does anyone see it differently? What am I missing here? Id really like to hear the other side of this story. Mean it . Sometimes people offer an invitation that sounds more like a threat than a legitimate call for opinions. Well, thats how I see it. Nobody disagrees, do they? Dont turn an invitation into a veiled threat. Invite people with both words and tone that say, I really want to hear from you. For instance: I know people have been reluctant to speak up about this, but I would really love to hear from everyone. Or: I know there are at least two sides to this story. Could we hear differing views now? What problems could this decision cause us? Play devils advocate . Occasionally you can tell that others are not buying into your facts or story, but theyre not speaking up either. Youve sincerely invited them, even encouraged differing views, but nobody says anything. To help grease the skids, play devils advocate. Model disagreeing by disagreeing with your own view. Maybe Im wrong here. What if the opposite is true? What if the reason sales have dropped is because . . . Do it until your motive becomes obvious . At timesparticularly if you are in a position of authorityeven being appropriately tentative doesnt prevent others from suspecting you want them to simply agree with you or that youre inviting them into a beating. This is particularly true when former bosses or authority figures have gently invited them to speak and then punished them for doing so. This is where the skill of encouraging testing comes into play. You can argue as vigorously as you want for your point of view, provided you are even more vigorous at encouragingeven pleading withothers to disprove it. The real test of whether your motive is to win a debate or engage in real dialogue is the degree to which you encourage testing. STRONG BELIEF Now lets turn our attention to another communication challenge. This time youre not offering delicate feedback or iffy stories; youre merely going to step into an argument and advocate your point of view. Its the kind of thing you do all the time. You do it at home, you do it at work, and yes, youve even been known to fire off an opinion or two while standing in line for a voting booth. Unfortunately, as stakes rise and others argue differing views and you just know in your heart of hearts that youre right and theyre wrong  you start pushing too hard. You simply have to win. Theres too much at risk and only you have the right ideas. Left to their own devices, others will mess things up. So when you care a great deal and are sure of your views, you dont merely speakyou try to force your opinions into the pool of meaning. You know, drown people in the truth. Quite naturally, others resist. You in turn push even harder. As consultants, we (the authors) watch this kind of thing happen all the time. For instance, seated around the table is a group of leaders who are starting to debate an important topic. First, someone hints that shes the only one with any real insight. Then someone else starts tossing out facts like so many poisonous darts. Anotherit just so happens someone with critical informationretreats into silence. As emotions rise, words that were once carefully chosen and tentatively delivered are now spouted with an absolute certainty that is typically reserved for claims that are nailed to church doors or carved on stone tablets. In the end, nobody is listening, everyone is committed to silence or violence, and the Pool of Shared Meaning remains parched and tainted. Nobody wins. How Did We Get Like This? It starts with a story . When we feel the need to push our ideas on others, its generally because we believe were right and everyone else is wrong. Theres no need to expand the pool of meaning, because we own the pool. We also firmly believe its our duty to fight for the truth that were holding. Its the honorable thing to do. Its what people of character do. Of course, others arent exactly villains in this story. They simply dont know any better. We, on the other hand, are modern-day heroes crusading against naivet and tunnel vision. We feel justified in using dirty tricks . Once were convinced that its our duty to fight for the truth, we start pulling out the big guns. We use debating tricks that weve picked up throughout the years. Chief among them is the ability to stack the deck. We cite information that supports our ideas while hiding or discrediting anything that doesnt. Then we spice things up with exaggeration: Everyone knows that this is the only way to go. When this doesnt work, we lace our language with inflammatory terms: All right-thinking people would agree with me. From there we employ any number of dirty tricks. We appeal to authority: Well, thats what the boss thinks. We attack the person: Youre not so naive as to actually believe that? We draw hasty generalizations: If it happened in our overseas operation, itll happen here for sure. We attack a straw man: Sure we can follow your planif we want to offend our top customers and lose the business. And again, the harder we try and the more forceful and nasty our tactics, the greater the resistance we create, the worse the results, and the more battered our relationships. How Do We Change? The solution to employing excessive advocacy is actually rather simpleif you can just bring yourself to do it. When you find yourself just dying to convince others that your way is best, back off your current attack and think about what you really want for yourself, others, and the relationship. Then ask yourself, How would I behave if these were the results I really wanted? When your adrenaline level gets below the 0.05 legal limit, youll be able to use your STATE skills. First, Learn to Look. Watch for the moment when people start to resist youperhaps they begin to raise their volume and/or overstate the facts behind their views in reaction to your tacticsor perhaps they retreat into silence. Turn your attention away from the topic (no matter how important) and onto yourself. Are you leaning forward? Are you speaking more loudly? Are you starting to try to win? Are you speaking in lengthy monologues and using dirty tricks? Remember: The more you care about an issue, the less likely you are to be on your best behavior . Second, tone down your approach. Open yourself up to the belief that others might have something to say, and better still, they might even hold a piece of the puzzleand then ask them for their views. Of course, this isnt easy. Backing off when we care the most is so counterintuitive that most of us have trouble doing so. Its not easy to soften your language when youre positive about something. And who wants to ask for other views when you know theyre wrong? Thats positively nuts. In fact, it can feel disingenuous to be tentative when your own strong belief is being brought into question. Of course, when you watch others shift from healthy dialogue to forcing their way on others, its obvious that if they dont back off, nobody will buy in. Thats when youre watching others . On the other hand, when we ourselves are pushing hard, its the correct thing to do. Right? Lets face it. When it comes to our strongest views, passion can be our enemy. Of course, feeling strongly about something isnt bad in and of itself. Its okay to have strong opinions. The problem comes when we try to express them.For instance, when we believe strongly in a concept or a cause, our emotions kick in and we start trying to force our way onto others. As our emotions kick in, our ideas no longer flow smoothly and gently into the pool. Instead, our thoughts shoot out of our mouths like water out of a raging fire hydrant. And guess what? Others become defensive. When this happens, when our emotions turn our ideas into a harsh and painful stream of thoughts, our honest passion kills the argument rather than supports it. Catch yourself . So whats a person to do? Catch yourself before you launch into a monologue. Realize that if youre starting to feel indignant or if you cant figure out why others dont buy inafter all, its so obvious to yourecognize that youre starting to enter dangerous territory. Back off your harsh and conclusive language. But dont back off your belief. Hold to your belief; merely soften your approach. SUMMARYSTATE MY PATH When you have a tough message to share, or when you are so convinced of your own rightness that you may push too hard, remember to STATE your path:  Share your facts . Start with the least controversial, most persuasive elements from your Path to Action.  Tell your story . Explain what youre beginning to conclude.  Ask for others paths . Encourage others to share both their facts and their stories.  Talk tentatively . State your story as a storydont disguise it as a fact.  Encourage testing . Make it safe for others to express differing or even opposing views.","Crucial Conversations - STATE My Path: How to Speak Persuasively, Not Abrasively","To speak your mind completely in a way that allows room for dialogue, you must express your views in ways that maintain safety, and you have to find a way to be both confident and humble.

"Over the past few months, your daughter Wendy has started to date a guy who looks like hes about ten minutes away from a felony arrest. After only a few weeks of dating this rather interesting fellow, Wendys clothing preference is now far too suggestive for your taste, and she routinely punctuates her language with expletives. When you carefully try to talk to her about these recent changes, she shouts accusations and insults and then withdraws to her room where she sulks for hours on end. Now what? Should you do something given that youre not the one going to silence or violence? When others do damage to the pool of meaning by clamming up (refusing to speak their minds) or blowing up (communicating in a way that is abusive and insulting), is there something you can do to get them back to dialogue? The answer is a resounding It depends. If you want to let a sleeping dog lie (or, in this case, a potential train wreck go unattended), then say nothing. Its the other person who seems to have something to say but refuses to open up. Its the other person whos blown a cork. Run for cover. You cant take responsibility for someone elses thoughts and feelings. Right? Then again, youll never work through your differences until all parties freely add to the pool of meaning. That requires the people who are blowing up or clamming up to participate as well. And while its true that you cant force others to dialogue, you can take steps to make it safer for them to do so. After all, thats why theyve sought the security of silence or violence in the first place. Theyre afraid that dialogue will make them vulnerable. Somehow they believe that if they engage in real conversation with you, bad things will happen to them. Your daughter, for instance, believes that if she talks with you, shell be lectured, grounded, and cut off from the only guy who seems to care about her. Restoring safety is your greatest hope to get your relationship back on track. EXPLORE OTHERS PATHS In Chapter 5, we recommended that whenever you notice safety is at risk, you should step out of the conversation and restore it. When you have offended others through a thoughtless act, apologize. Or if someone has misunderstood your intent, use Contrasting. Explain what you do and dont intend. Finally, if youre simply at odds, find a Mutual Purpose. Now we add one more skill: Explore Others Paths . Since weve added a model of whats going on inside another persons head (the Path to Action), we now have a whole new tool for helping others feel safe. If we can find a way to let others know that its okay to share their Path to Action their facts and, yes, even their nasty stories and ugly feelingsthen theyll be more likely to open up. But what does it take? Start with HeartGet Ready to Listen Be sincere . To get others facts and stories into the pool of meaning, we have to invite them to share whats on their minds. Well look at how to do this in a minute. For now, lets highlight the point that when you do invite people to share their views, you must mean it. For example, consider the following incident. A patient is exiting a health care facility. The desk attendant can tell that she is a bit uneasy, maybe even dissatisfied. Did everything go all right with the procedure? the clerk asks. Mostly, the patient replies. (If ever there was a hint that something was wrong, the term mostly has to be it.) Good, the clerk abruptly responds and then follows with a resounding, Next! This is a classic case of pretending to be interested. It falls under the How are you today? category of inquiries. Meaning: Please dont say anything of substance. Im really just making small talk. When you ask people to open up, be prepared to listen. Be curious . When you do want to hear from others (and you should because it adds to the pool of meaning), the best way to get at the truth is by making it safe for them to express the stories that are moving them to either silence or violence. This means that at the very moment when most people become furious, we need to become curious. Rather than respond in kind, we need to wonder whats behind the ruckus. But how? How can we possibly act curious when others are either attacking us or heading for cover? People who routinely seek to find out why others are feeling unsafe do so because they have learned that getting at the source of fear and discomfort is the best way to return to dialogue. Either theyve seen others do it or theyve stumbled on the formula themselves. Either way, they realize that the cure to silence or violence isnt to respond in kind, but to get at the underlying source. This calls for genuine curiosityat a time when youre likely to be feeling frustrated or angry. To help turn your visceral tendency to respond in kind into genuine curiosity, look for opportunities to be curious. Start with a situation where you observe someone becoming emotional and youre still under controlsuch as a meeting (when youre not personally under attack and are less likely to get hooked). Do your best to get at the persons source of fear or anger. Look for chances to turn on your curiosity rather than kick-start your adrenaline. In this case, the patient is reluctant to speak up. Perhaps if she shares her honest opinion, she will insult the doctor, or maybe the loyal staff members will become offended. To deal with the problem, the desk attendant lets the patient know (as much with his tone as with his words) that its safe to talk, and she opens up. Stay curious . When people begin to share their volatile stories and feelings, we now face the risk of pulling out our own Victim, Villain, and Helpless Stories to help us explain why theyre saying what theyre saying. Unfortunately, since its rarely fun to hear other peoples unflatteringstories, we begin to assign negative motives to them for telling the stories. For example: C LERK : Well arent you the ungrateful one! The kind doctor devotes his whole life to helping people and now that hes a little gray around the edges, you want to send him out to pasture! To avoid overreacting to others stories, stay curious. Give your brain a problem to stay focused on. Ask: Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person say this? This question keeps you retracing the other persons Path to Action until you see how it all fits together. And in most cases, you end up seeing that under the circumstances, the individual in question drew a fairly reasonable conclusion. Be patient . When others are acting out their feelings and opinions through silence or violence, its a good bet theyre starting to feel the effects of adrenaline. Even if we do our best to safely and effectively respond to the other persons verbal attack, we still have to face up to the fact that its going to take a little while for him or her to settle down. Say, for example, that a friend dumps out an ugly story and you treat it with respect and continue on with the conversation. Even if the two of you now share a similar view, it may seem like your friend is still pushing too hard. While its natural to move quickly from one thought to the next, strong emotions take a while to subside. Once the chemicals that fuel emotions are released, they hang around in the bloodstream for a timein some cases, long after thoughts have changed. So be patient when exploring how others think and feel. Encourage them to share their path and then wait for their emotions to catch up with the safety that youve created. Encourage Others to Retrace Their Path Once youve decided to maintain a curious approach, its time to help the other person retrace his or her Path to Action. Unfortunately, most of us fail to do so. Thats because when others start playing silence or violence games, were joining the conversation at the end of their Path to Action. Theyve seen and heard things, told themselves a story or two, generated a feeling (possibly a mix of fear and anger or disappointment), and now theyre starting to act out their story. Thats where we come in. Now, even though we may be hearing their first words, were coming in somewhere near the end of their path. On the Path to Action model, were seeing the action at the end of the pathas shown in Figure 8-1. Every sentence has a history . To get a feel for how complicated and unnerving this process is, remember how you felt the last time your favorite mystery show started late because a football game ran long. As the game wraps up, the screen cross-fades from a trio of announcers to a starlet standing over a murder victim. Along the bottom of the screen are the discomforting words, We now join this program already in progress. You shake the remote in exasperation. Youve missed the entire setup! For the rest of the program you end up guessing about key facts. What happened before you joined in? Crucial conversations can be similarly mysterious and frustrating. When others are in either silence or violence, were actually joining their Path to Action already in progress . Consequently, weve already missed the foundation of the story and were confused. If were not careful, we can become defensive. After all, not only are we joining late, but were also joining at a time when the other person is starting to act offensively. Break the cycle . And then guess what happens? When were on the receiving end of someones retributions, accusations, and cheap shots, rarely do we think: My, what an interesting story he or she must have told. What do you suppose led to that? Instead, we match this unhealthy behavior. Our genetically shaped, eons-old defense mechanisms kick in, and we create our own hasty and ugly Path to Action. People who know better cut this dangerous cycle by stepping out of the interaction and making it safe for the other person to talk about his or her Path to Action. They perform this feat by encouraging him or her to move away from harsh feelings and knee-jerk reactions and toward the root cause. In essence, they retrace the other persons Path to Action together. At their encouragement, the other person moves from his or her emotions, to what he or she concluded, to what he or she observed. When we help others retrace their path to its origins, not only do we help curb our reaction, but we also return to the place where the feelings can be resolvedat the source, that is, the facts and the story behind the emotion. Inquiry Skills When? So far weve suggested that when other people appear to have a story to tell and facts to share, its our job to invite them to do so. Our cues are simple: Others are going to silence or violence. We can see that theyre feeling upset, fearful, or angry. We can see that if we dont get at the source of their feelings, well end up suffering the effects of the feelings. These external reactions are our cues to do whatever it takes to help others retrace their Paths to Action. How? Weve also suggested that whatever we do to invite the other person to open up and share his or her path, our invitation must be sincere. As hard as it sounds, we must be genuine in the face of hostility, fear, or even abusewhich leads us to the next question. What? What are we supposed to actually do? What does it take to get others to share their pathstories and facts alike? In a word, it requires listening . In order for people to move from acting on their feelings to talking about their conclusions and observations, we must listen in a way that makes it safe for others to share their intimate thoughts. They must believe that when they share their thoughts, they wont offend others or be punished for speaking frankly. Ask, Mirror, Paraphrase, or Prime (AMPP) To encourage others to share their paths well use four power listening tools that can help make it safe for other people to speak frankly. We call thefour skills power listening tools because they are best remembered with the acronym AMPP Ask, Mirror, Paraphrase , and Prime . Luckily, the tools work for both silence and violence games. Ask to Get Things Rolling The easiest and most straightforward way to encourage others to share their Path to Action is simply to invite them to express themselves. For example, often all it takes to break an impasse is to seek to understand others views. When we show genuine interest, people feel less compelled to use silence or violence. For example: Do you like my new dress, or are you going to call the modesty police? Wendy smirks. What do you mean? you ask. Id like to hear your concerns. If youre willing to stop filling the pool with your meaning and step back and invite the other person to talk about his or her view, it can go a long way toward breaking the downward spiral and getting to the source of the problem. Mirror to Confirm Feelings If asking others to share their path doesnt open things up, mirroring can help build more safety. In mirroring, we take the portion of the other persons Path to Action we have access to and make it safe for him or her to discuss it. All we have so far are actions and some hints about the other persons emotions, so we start there. When we mirror, as the name suggests, we play the role of mirror by describing how they look or act. Although we may not understand others stories or facts, we can see their actions and reflect them back. Mirroring is most useful when another persons tone of voice or gestures (hints about the emotions behind them) are inconsistent with his or her words. For example: Dont worry. Im fine. (But the person in question is saying this with a look and tone that suggests he is actually quite upset. Hes frowning, looking around, and sort of kicking at the ground.) Really? From the way youre saying that, it doesnt sound like you are. We explain that while the person may be saying one thing, his or her tone of voice or body posture suggests something else. In doing so, by staying with the observed actions, we show both respect and concern for him or her. When reflecting back your observations, take care to manage your tone of voice and delivery. It is not the fact that we are acknowledging others emotions that creates safety. We create safety when our tone of voice says were okay with them feeling the way theyre feeling. If we do this well, they may conclude that rather than acting out their emotions, they can confidently talk them out with us instead. So as we describe what we see, we have to do so calmly. If we act upset or as if were not going to like what others say, we dont build safety. We confirm their suspicions that they need to remain silent. Paraphrase to Acknowledge the Story Asking and mirroring may help you get part of the other persons story out into the open. When you get a clue about why the person is feeling as he or she does, you can build additional safety by paraphrasing what youve heard. Be careful not to simply parrot back what was said. Instead, put the message in your own wordsusually in an abbreviated form. Lets see if Ive got this right. Youre upset because Ive voiced my concern about some of the clothes you wear. And this seems controlling or old-fashioned to you. The key to paraphrasing, as with mirroring, is to remain calm and collected. Our goal is to make it safe, not to act horrified and suggest that the conversation is about to turn ugly. Stay focused on figuring out how a reasonable, rational, and decent person could have created this Path to Action. This will help you keep from becoming angry or defensive. Simply rephrase what the person has said, and do it in a way that suggests that its okay, youre trying to understand, and its safe for him or her to talk candidly. Dont push too hard . Lets see where we are. We can tell that another person has more to share than he or she is currently sharing. He or she is going to silence or violence, and we want to know why. We want to get back to the source (the facts) where we can solve the problem. To encourage the person to share, weve tried three listening tools. Weve asked, mirrored, and paraphrased. The person is still upset, but isnt explaining his or her stories or facts. Now what? At this point, we may want to back off. After a while, our attempts to make it safe for others can start feeli
g as if were pestering or prying. If we push too hard, we violate both purpose and respect. Others may think our purpose is merely to extract what we want from them and conclude that we dont care about them personally. So instead, we back off. Rather than trying to get to the source of the other persons emotions, we either gracefully exit or ask what he or she wants to see happen. Asking people what they want helps them engage their brains in a way that moves to problem solving and away from either attacking or avoiding. It also helps reveal what they think the cause of the problem is. Prime When Youre Getting Nowhere On the other hand, there are times when you may conclude that others would like to open up, but still dont feel safe. Or maybe theyre still in violence, havent come down from the adrenaline, and arent explaining why theyre angry. When this is the case, you might want to try priming. Prime when you believe that the other person still has something to share and might do so with a little more effort on your part. The power-listening term priming comes from the expression priming the pump. If youve ever worked an old-fashioned hand pump, youunderstand the metaphor. With a pump, you often have to pour some water into it to get it running. Then it works just fine. When it comes to power listening, sometimes you have to offer your best guess at what the other person is thinking or feeling before you can expect him or her to do the same. You have to pour some meaning into the pool before the other person will respond in kind. A few years back, one of the authors was working with an executive team that had decided to add an afternoon shift to one of the companys work areas. The equipment wasnt being fully utilized, and the company couldnt afford to keep the area open without adding a three-to-midnight crew. This, of course, meant that the people currently working days would now have to rotate every two weeks to afternoons. It was a tortured but necessary choice. As the execs held a meeting to announce the unpopular change, the existing employees went silent. They were obviously unhappy, but nobody would say anything. The operations manager was afraid that people would misinterpret the companys actions as nothing more than a grab for more money. In truth, the area was losing money, but the decision was made with the current employees in mind. With no second shift, there would be no jobs. He also knew that asking people to rotate shifts and to be away from loved ones during the afternoon and evening would cause horrible burdens. As people sat silently fuming, the executive did his best to get them to talk so that they wouldnt walk away with unresolved feelings. He mirrored, I can see youre upsetwho wouldnt be? Is there anything we can do? Nothing. Finally, he primed. That is, he took his best guess at what they might be thinking, said it in a way that showed it was okay to talk about it, and then went on from there. Are you thinking that the only reason were doing this is to make money? That maybe we dont care about your personal lives? After a brief pause, someone answered: Well, it sure looks like that. Do you have any idea how much trouble this is going to cause? Then someone else chimed in and the discussion was off and running. Now, this is not the kind of thing you would do unless nothing else has worked. You really want to hear from others, and you have a very strong idea of what theyre probably thinking. Priming is an act of good faith, taking risks, becoming vulnerable, and building safety in hopes that others will share their meaning. But What If Theyre Wrong? Sometimes it feels dangerous to sincerely explore the views of someone whose path is wildly different from your own. He or she could be completely wrong, and were acting calm and collected. This makes us nervous. To keep ourselves from feeling nervous while exploring others pathsno matter how different or wrong they seemremember were trying to understand their point of view, not necessarily agree with it or support it. Understanding doesnt equate with agreement. Sensitivity does equate to acquiescence. By taking steps to understand another persons Path to Action, we are promising that well accept their point of view. There will be plenty of time later for us to share our path as well. For now, were merely trying to get at what others think in order to understand why theyre feeling the way theyre feeling and doing what theyre doing. EXPLORING WENDYS PATH Now lets put the several skills together in a single interaction. Well return to Wendy. She has just come home from a date with the guy who has you frightened. You yank the door open, pull Wendy into the house, and double-bolt your entrance. Then you talk, sort of. REMEMBER YOUR ABCS Lets say you did your level best to make it safe for the other person to talk. After asking, mirroring, paraphrasing, and eventually priming, the other person opened up and shared his or her path. Its now your turn to talk. But what if you disagree? Some of the other persons facts are wrong, and his or her stories are completely fouled up. Well, at least theyre a lot different from the story youve been telling. Now what? Agree As you watch families and work groups take part in heated debates, its common to notice a rather intriguing phenomenon. Although the various parties youre observing are violently arguing, in truth, theyre in violent agreement . They actually agree on every important point, but theyre still fighting. Theyve found a way to turn subtle differences into a raging debate. For example, last night your teenage son broke his curfew again. You and your spouse have spent the morning arguing about the infraction. Last time James came in late, you agreed to ground him, but today youre upset because it seems like your spouse is backpedaling by suggesting that James still be able to attend a football camp this week. Turns out it was just a misunderstanding. You and your spouse agree to the groundingthe central issue. You thought your spouse was reneging on the agreement when, in truth, you just hadnt actually resolved the date the grounding would start. You had to step back and listen to what you were both saying to realize that you werent really disagreeing, but violently agreeing. Most arguments consist of battles over the 5 to 10 percent of the facts and stories that people disagree over. And while its true that people eventually need to work through differences, you shouldnt start there. Start with an area of agreement. So heres the take-away. If you completely agree with the other persons path, say so and move on. Agree when you agree. Dont turn an agreement into an argument. Build Of course, the reason most of us turn agreements into debates is because we disagree with a certain portion of what the other person has said. Never mind that its a minor portion. If its a point of disagreement, well jump all over it like a fleeing criminal. Actually, were trained to look for minor errors from an early age. For instance, we learn in kindergarten that if you have the right answer, youre the teachers pet. Being right is good. Of course, if others have the right answer they get to be the pet. So being right first is even better. You learn to look for even the tiniest of errors in others facts, thinking, or logic. Then you point out the errors. Being right at the expense of others is best. By the time you finish your education, you have a virtual Ph.D. in catching trivial differences and turning them into a major deal. So when another person offers up a suggestion (based on facts and stories), youre looking to disagree. And when you do find a minor difference, you turn this snack into a meal. Instead of remaining in healthy dialogue, you end up in violent agreement. On the other hand, when you watch people who are skilled in dialogue, it becomes clear that theyre not playing this everyday game of Trivial Pursuitlooking for trivial differences and then proclaiming them aloud. In fact, theyre looking for points of agreement. As a result, theyll often start with the words I agree. Then they talk about the part they agree with. At least, thats where they start. Now when the other person has merely left out an element of the argument, skilled people will agree and then build. Rather than saying: Wrong. You forgot to mention . . ., they say: Absolutely. In addition, I noticed that. . . If you agree with what has been said but the information is incomplete, build. Point out areas of agreement, and then add elements that were left out of the discussion. Compare Finally, if you do disagree, compare your path with the other persons. That is, rather than suggesting that he or she is wrong, suggest that you differ. He or she may, in fact, be wrong, but you dont know for sure until you hear both sides of the story. For now, you just know that the two of you differ. So instead of pronouncing Wrong! start with a tentative but candid opening, such as I think I see things differently. Let me describe how. Then share your path using the STATE skills from Chapter 7. That is, begin by sharing your observations. Share them tentatively, and invite others to test your ideas. After youve shared your path, invite the other person to help you compare it with his or her experience. Work together to explore and explain the differences. In summary, to help remember these skills, think of your ABCs. Agree when you agree. Build when others leave out key pieces. Compare when you differ. Dont turn differences into debates that lead to unhealthy relationships and bad results. SUMMARYEXPLORE OTHERS PATHS To encourage the free flow of meaning and help others leave silence or violence behind, explore their Paths to Action. Start with an attitude of curiosity and patience. This helps restore safety. Then, use four powerful listening skills to retrace the other persons Path to Action to its origins.  Ask . Start by simply expressing interest in the other persons views.  Mirror . Increase safety by respectfully acknowledging the emotions people appear to be feeling.  Paraphrase . As others begin to share part of their story, restate what youve heard to show not just that you understand, but also that its safe for them to share what theyre thinking.  Prime . If others continue to hold back, prime. Take your best guess at what they may be thinking and feeling. As you begin to share your views, remember:  Agree . Agree when you share views.  Build . If others leave something out, agree where you share views, then build.  Compare . When you do differ significantly, dont suggest others are wrong. Compare your two views.",Crucial Conversations - Explore Others Paths: How to Listen When Others Blow Up or Clam Up,"As we see others moving to silence or violencesharing mostly stories or very little at allit helps us stay in dialogue if we can encourage them to share their entire Path to Action, or the explanation of how emotions, thoughts, and experiences lead to our actions. We have to find a way to move others back to their facts. We typically join them at the end of their Path to Action. They show us their feelings and share their stories, but we may not know what they actually observed. We know what they think, but we dont know what we or others may have done. When others go to silence or violence, actively explore their path. Exploring helps others move away from harsh feelings and knee-jerk reactions and toward the root causes of those feelings and reactions. It also helps curb our own defensive response. Rather than ask, Whats the worst and most personal way I can take this? (leading to defensiveness), we should ask, Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person think or feel this way? (leading to curiosity). Its hard to feel defensive and curious at the same time. Finally, it takes us to the only place where the feelings can be resolved: The source (the facts and story behind the emotions)."
"Up until this point weve suggested that getting more meaning into the pool helps with dialogue. Its the one thing that helps people make savvy decisions that, in turn, lead to smart, unified, and committed actions. In order to encourage this free flow of meaning, weve shared the skills weve been able to learn by watching people who are gifted at dialogue. By now, if youve followed some or all of this advice, youre walking around with full pools. People who walk near you should hear the sloshing. Its time we add two final skills. Having more meaning in the pool, even jointly owning it, doesnt guarantee that we all agree on what were going to do with the meaning. For example, when teams or families meet and generate a host of ideas, they often fail to convert the ideas into action for two reasons:  They have unclear expectations about how decisions will be made.  They do a poor job of acting on the decisions they do make. This can be dangerous. In fact, when people move from adding meaning to the pool to moving to action, its a prime time for new challenges to arise. Who is supposed to take the assignment? That can be controversial. How are we supposed to decide in the first place? That can be emotional. Lets take a look at what it takes to solve each of these problems. First, making decisions. DIALOGUE IS NOT DECISION MAKING The two riskiest times in crucial conversations tend to be at the beginning and at the end. The beginning is risky because you have to find a way to create safety or else things go awry. The end is dicey because if you arent careful about how you clarify the conclusion and decisions flowing from your Pool of Shared Meaning, you can run into violated expectations later on. This can happen in two ways. How are decisions going to be made? First, people may not understand how decisions are going to be made. For example, Cara is miffed. Rene just plunked down a brochure for a three-day cruise and announced he had made reservations and even paid the $500 deposit for an outside suite. A week ago they had a crucial conversation about vacation plans. Both expressed their views and preferences respectfully and candidly. It wasnt easy, but at the end they concluded a cruise suited both quite well. And yet Cara is miffed, and Rene is stunned that Cara is anything less than ecstatic. Cara agreed in principle about a cruise. She didnt agree with this particular cruise. Rene thought that any cruise would be fine and made a decision on his own. Have fun on the cruise, Rene. Are we ever going to decide? The second problem with decision making occurs when no decision gets made. Either ideas slip away and dissipate, or people cant figure out what to do with them. Or maybe everyone is waiting for everyone else to make the decisions. Hey, we filled the pool. Now you do something with it. In any case, decisions drag on forever. DECIDE HOW TO DECIDE Both of these problems are solved if, before making a decision, the people involved decide how to decide. Dont allow people to assume that dialogue is decision making. Dialogue is a process for getting all relevant meaning into a shared pool. That process, of course, involves everyone. However, simply because everyone is allowed to share their meaningactually encouraged to share their meaningdoesnt mean they are then guaranteed to take part in making all the decisions. To avoid violated expectations, separate dialogue from decision making. Make it clear how decisions will be madewho will be involved and why. When the line of authority is clear . When youre in a position of authority, you decide which method of decision making youll use. Managers and parents, for example, decide how to decide. Its part of their responsibility as leaders. For instance, VPs dont ask hourly employees to decide on pricing changes or product lines. Thats the leaders job. Parents dont ask small children to pick their home security device or to set their own curfew. Thats the job of the parent. Of course, both leaders and parents turn more decisions over to their direct reports and children when they warrant the responsibility, but its still the authority figure who decides what method of decision making to employ. Deciding what decisions to turn over and when to do it is part of their stewardship. When the line of authority isnt clear . When there is no clear line of authority, deciding how to decide can be quite difficult. For instance, consider a conversation we referred to earlierthe one you had with your daughters schoolteacher. Should you hold your child back? Whose choice is this anyway? Who decides whose choice it is? Does everyone have a say, then a vote? Is it the school officials responsibility, so they choose? Since parents have ultimate responsibility, should they consult with the appropriate experts and then decide? Is there even a clear answer to this tough question? A case like this is hand-tooled for dialogue. All of the participants need to get their meaning into the poolincluding their opinions about who should make the final choice. Thats part of the meaning you need to discuss. If you dont openly talk about who decides and why, and your opinions vary widely, youre likely to end up in a heated battle that can only be resolved in court. Handled poorly, thats exactly where these kinds of issues are resolved The Jones Family vs. Happy Valley School District . So whats a person to do? Talk openly about your childs abilities and interests as well as about how the final choice will be made. Dont mention lawyers or a lawsuit in your opening comments; this only reduces safety and sets up an adversarial climate. Your goal is to have an open, honest, and healthy discussion about a child, not to exert your influence, make threats, or somehow beat the educators. Stick with the opinions of the experts at hand, and discuss how and why they should be involved. When decision-making authority is unclear, use your best dialogue skills to get meaning into the pool. Jointly decide how to decide. The Four Methods of Decision MakingWhen youre deciding how to decide, it helps to have a way of talking about the decision-making options available. There are four common ways of making decisions: command, consult, vote, and consensus. These four options represent increasing degrees of involvement. Increased involvement, of course, brings the benefit of increased commitment along with the curse of decreased decision-making efficiency. Savvy people choose from among these four methods of decision making the one that best suits their particular circumstances. Command Lets start with decisions that are made with no involvement whatsoever. This happens in one of two ways. Either outside forces place demands on us (demands that leave us no wiggle room), or we turn decisions over to others and then follow their lead. We dont care enough to be involvedlet someone else do the work. In the case of external forces, customers set prices, agencies mandate safety standards, and other governing bodies simply hand us demands. As much as employees like to think their bosses are sitting around making choices, for the most part theyre simply passing on the demands of the circumstances. These are command decisions. With command decisions, its not our job to decide what to do. Its our job to decide how to make it work. In the case of turning decisions over to others, we decide either that this is such a low-stakes issue that we dont care enough to take part or that we completely trust the ability of the delegate to make the right decision. More involvement adds nothing. In strong teams and great relationships, many decisions are made by turning the final choice over to someone we trust to make a good decision. We dont want to take the time ourselves and gladly turn the decision over to others. Consult Consulting is a process whereby decision makers invite others to influence them before they make their choice. You can consult with experts, a representative population, or even everyone who wants to offer an opinion. Consulting can be an efficient way of gaining ideas and support without bogging down the decision-making process. At least not too much. Wise leaders, parents, and even couples frequently make decisions in this way. They gather ideas, evaluate options, make a choice, and then inform the broader population. Vote Voting is best suited to situations where efficiency is the highest valueand youre selecting from a number of good options. Members of the team realize they may not get their first choice, but frankly they dont want to waste time talking the issue to death. They may discuss options for a while and then call for a vote. When facing several decent options, voting is a great time saver but should never be used when team members dont agree to support whatever decision is made. In these cases, consensus is required. Consensus This method can be both a great blessing and a frustrating curse. Consensus means you talk until everyone honestly agrees to one decision. This method can produce tremendous unity and high-quality decisions. If misapplied, it can also be a horrible waste of time. It should only be used with (1) high-stakes and complex issues or (2) issues where everyone absolutely must support the final choice. HOW TO CHOOSE Now that we know the four methods, lets explore which method to use at which timealong with some hints about how to avoid common blunders. MAKE ASSIGNMENTSPUT DECISIONS INTO ACTION Now lets take a look at the final step. Youve engaged in healthy dialogue, filled the pool of meaning, decided how youre going to draw from the pool, and eventually come to some decisions. Its time to do something. Some of the items may have been completely resolved during the discussion, but many may require a person or team to do something. Youll have to make assignments. Who? To quote an English proverb, Everybodys business is nobodys business. If you dont make an actual assignment to an actual person, theres a good chance that nothing will ever come of all the work youve gone through to make a decision. When its time to pass out assignments, remember, there is no we. We, when it comes to assignments, actually means, not me. Its code. Even when individuals are not trying to duck an assignment, the term we can lead them to believe that others are taking on the responsibility. Assign a name to every responsibility. This especially applies at home. If youre divvying up household chores, be sure youve got a specific person to go with each chore. That is, if you assign two or three people to take on a task, appoint one of them the responsible party. Otherwise, any sense of responsibility will be lost in a flurry of finger-pointing later on. Does What? Be sure to spell out the exact deliverables you have in mind. The fuzzier the expectations, the higher the likelihood of disappointment. For example, the eccentric entrepreneur Howard Hughes once assigned a team of engineers to design and build the worlds first steam-powered car. When sharing his dream of a vehicle that could run on heated water, he gave them virtually no direction. After several years of intense labor, the engineers successfully produced the first prototype by running dozens of pipes through the cars body thus solving the problem of where to put all the water required to run a steam-powered car. The vehicle was essentially a giant radiator. When Hughes asked the engineers what would happen if the car got into a wreck, they nervously explained that the passengers would be boiled alive, much like lobsters in a pot. Hughes was so upset in what the crew came up with that he insisted they cut it up into pieces no larger than three inches. That was the end of the project. Learn from Hughes. When youre first agreeing on an assignment, clarify up front the exact details of what you want. Couples get into trouble in this area when one of the parties doesnt want to take the time to think carefully about the deliverables and then later on becomes upset because his or her unstated desires werent met. Have you ever remodeled a room with a loved one? Then you know what were talking about. Better to spend the time up front clarifying exactly what you want rather than waste resources and hurt feelings on the back end. To help clarify deliverables, use Contrasting. If youve seen people misunderstand an assignment in the past, explain the common mistake as an example of what you dont want. If possible, point to physical examples. Rather than talk in the abstract, bring a prototype or sample. We learned this particular trick when hiring a set designer. The renowned designer talked about what he would deliver, and it sounded great to us. Twenty-five thousand dollars later he delivered something that would never work. We had to start over from scratch. From that day on weve learned to point to pictures and talk about what we want and dont want. The clearer the picture of the deliverable, the less likely youll be unpleasantly surprised. By When? Its shocking how often people leave this element out of an assignment. Instead of giving a deadline, people simply point to the setting sun of someday. With vague or unspoken deadlines, other urgencies come up, and the assignment finds its way to the bottom of the pile, where it is soon forgotten. Assignments without deadlines are far better at producing guilt than stimulating action. Goals without deadlines arent goals; theyre merely directions. How Will You Follow Up? Always agree on how often and by what method youll follow up on the assignment. It could be a simple e-mail confirming the completion of a project. It might be a full report in a team or family meeting. More often than not, it comes down to progress checks along the way. Its actually fairly easy to build follow-up methods into the assignment. For example: Call me on my cell phone when you finish your homework. Then you can go play with friends. Okay? Or perhaps youll prefer to rely on milestones: Let me know when youve completed your library research. Then well sit down and look at the next steps. Milestones, of course, must be linked to a drop-dead date. Let me know as soon youve completed the research component of this project. Youve got until the last week in November, but if you finish earlier, give me a call. Remember, if you want people to feel accountable, you must give them an opportunity to account. Build an expectation for follow-up into every assignment. DOCUMENT YOUR WORK Once again, a proverb comes to mind. One dull pencil is worth six sharp minds. Dont leave your hard work to memory. If youve gone to the effort to complete a crucial conversation, dont fritter away all the meaning you created by trusting your memories. Write down the details of conclusions, decisions, and assignments. Remember to record who does what by when. Revisit your notes at key times (usually the next meeting) and review assignments. As you review what was supposed to be completed, hold people accountable. When someone fails to deliver on a promise, its time for dialogue. Discuss the issue by using the STATE skills we covered in Chapter 7. By holding people accountable, not only do you increase their motivation and ability to deliver on promises, but you create a culture of integrity. SUMMARYMOVE TO ACTION Turn your successful crucial conversations into great decisions and united action by avoiding the two traps of violated expectations and inaction. Decide How to Decide  Command . Decisions are made without involving others.  Consult . Input is gathered from the group and then a subset decides.  Vote . An agreed-upon percentage swings the decision.  Consensus . Everyone comes to an agreement and then supports the final decision. Finish ClearlyDetermine who does what by when . Make the deliverables crystal clear. Set a follow-up time. Record the commitments and then follow up. Finally, hold people accountable to their promises.",Crucial Conversations - Move to Action: How to Turn Crucial Conversations into Action and Results,"The ultimate goal of dialogue is not just to create a healthy climate or even a clear understanding between parties. While both are helpful outcomes, both fall short of the real purpose: To get unstuck by taking the appropriate action. If you dont take action, all the healthy talk in the world is for nothing and will eventually lead to disappointment and hard feelings. Always agree on when and how follow-up will occur. It could be a simple e-mail confirming action by a certain date. It could be a full report in a team meeting. It could be just one report upon completion, or it could be progress checks along the way. Regardless of the method or frequency, follow-up is critical in creating action. There is no accountability if there is not an opportunity to account for action. Document your work. Effective teams and healthy relationships are supported by records of the important decisions made after difficult dialogues, and the assignments agreed upon. Good teams revisit these documents to follow up on both the decisions and the commitments. When someone fails to keep a commitment, candidly and directly discuss the issue with him or her. As you do so, everyone benefits in two ways. First, you increase the motivation and ability of the individual to do better. Second, you develop a culture of integrity in the team or relationshipletting everyone know that keeping commitments is an important value."
"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jems fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldnt have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt. When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out. I said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing, it really began with Andrew Jackson. If General Jackson hadnt run the Creeks up the creek, Simon Finch would never have paddled up the Alabama, and where would we be if he hadnt? We were far too old to settle an argument with a fist-fight, so we consulted Atticus. Our father said we were both right. Being Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the family that we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of Hastings. All we had was Simon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was exceeded only by his stinginess. In England, Simon was irritated by the persecution of those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more liberal brethren, and as Simon called himself a Methodist, he worked his way across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence to Mobile, and up the Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesleys strictures on the use of many words in buying and selling, Simon made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory of God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. So Simon, having forgotten his teachers dictum on the possession of human chattels, bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the Alabama River some forty miles above Saint Stephens. He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find a wife, and with her established a line that ran high todaughters. Simon lived to an impressive age and died rich. It was customary for the men in the family to remain on Simons homestead, Finchs Landing, and make their living from cotton. The place was self-sufficient: modest in comparison with the empires around it, the Landing nevertheless produced everything required to sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles of clothing, supplied by river- boats from Mobile. Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the North and the South, as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land, yet the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century, when my father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his younger brother went to Boston to study medicine. Their sister Alexandra was the Finch who remained at the Landing: she married a taciturn man who spent most of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trot-lines were full. When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began his practice. Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finchs Landing, was the county seat of Maycomb County. Atticuss office in the courthouse contained little more than a hat rack, a spittoon, a checkerboard and an unsullied Code of Alabama. His first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail. Atticus had urged them to accept the states generosity in allowing them to plead Guilty to second-degree murder and escape with their lives, but they were Haverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with jackass. The Haverfords had dispatched Maycombs leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three witnesses, and insisted thatthe- son-of-a-bitch-had-it-coming-to-him was a good enough defense for anybody. They persisted in pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much Atticus could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was probably the beginning of my fathers profound distaste for the practice of criminal law. During his first five years in Maycomb, Atticus practiced economy more than anything; for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brothers education. John Hale Finch was ten years younger than my father, and chose to study medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing; but after getting Uncle Jack started, Atticus derived a reasonable income from the law. He liked Maycomb, he was Maycomb County born and bred; he knew his people, they knew him, and because of Simon Finchs industry, Atticus was related by blood or marriage to nearly every family in the town.  Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summers day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Mens stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-oclock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum. People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of the stores around it, took their time about everything. A day was twenty-four hours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County. But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people: Maycomb County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself. We lived on the main residential street in townAtticus, Jem and I, plus Calpurnia our cook. Jem and I found our father satisfactory: he played with us, read to us, and treated us with courteous detachment. Calpurnia was something else again. She was all angles and bones; she was nearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard. She was always ordering me out of the kitchen, asking me why I couldnt behave as well as Jem when she knew he was older, and calling me home when I wasnt ready to come. Our battles were epic and one-sided. Calpurnia always won, mainly because Atticus always took her side. She had been with us ever since Jem was born, and I had felt her tyrannical presence as long as I could remember. Our mother died when I was two, so I never felt her absence. She was a Graham from Montgomery; Atticus met her when he was first elected to the state legislature. He was middle-aged then, she was fifteen years his junior. Jem was the product of their first year of marriage; four years later I was born, and two years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack. They said it ran in her family. I did not miss her, but I think Jem did. He remembered her clearly, and sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length, then go off and play by himself behind the car-house. When he was like that, I knew better than to botherhim. When I was almost six and Jem was nearly ten, our summertime boundaries (within calling distance of Calpurnia) were Mrs. Henry Lafayette Duboses house two doors to the north of us, and the Radley Place three doors to the south. We were never tempted to break them. The Radley Place was inhabited by an unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for days on end; Mrs. Dubose was plain hell. That was the summer Dill came to us. Early one morning as we were beginning our days play in the back yard, Jem and I heard something next door in Miss Rachel Haverfords collard patch. We went to the wire fence to see if there was a puppyMiss Rachels rat terrier was expecting instead we found someone sitting looking at us. Sitting down, he wasnt much higher than the collards. We stared at him until he spoke: Hey. Hey yourself, said Jem pleasantly. Im Charles Baker Harris, he said. I can read. So what? I said. I just thought youd like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin I can do it How old are you, asked Jem, four-and-a-half? Goin on seven. Shoot no wonder, then, said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. Scout yonders been readin ever since she was born, and she aint even started to school yet. You look right puny for goin on seven. Im little but Im old, he said. Jem brushed his hair back to get a better look. Why dont you come over, Charles Baker Harris? he said. Lord, what a name. s not any funniern yours. Aunt Rachel says your names Jeremy Atticus Finch. Jem scowled. Im big enough to fit mine, he said. Your names longern you are. Bet its a foot longer. Folks call me Dill, said Dill, struggling under the fence. Do better if you go over it instead of under it, I said. Whered you come from? Dill was from Meridian, Mississippi, was spending the summer with his aunt, Miss Rachel, and would be spending every summer in Maycomb from now on. His family was from Maycomb County originally, his mother worked for a photographer in Meridian, had entered his picture in a Beautiful Child contest and won five dollars. She gave the money to Dill, who went to the picture show twenty times onit. Dont have any picture shows here, except Jesus ones in the courthouse sometimes, said Jem. Ever see anything good? Dill had seenDracula, a revelation that moved Jem to eye him with the beginning of respect. Tell it to us, he said. Dill was a curiosity. He wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt, his hair was snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff; he was a year my senior but I towered over him. As he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and darken; his laugh was sudden and happy; he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of his forehead. When Dill reduced Dracula to dust, and Jem said the show sounded better than the book, I asked Dill where his father was: You aint said anything about him. I havent got one. Is he dead? No Then if hes not dead youve got one, havent you? Dill blushed and Jem told me to hush, a sure sign that Dill had been studied and found acceptable. Thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment. Routine contentment was: improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin chinaberry trees in the back yard, fussing, running through our list of dramas based on the works of Oliver Optic, Victor Appleton, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. In this matter we were lucky to have Dill. He played the character parts formerly thrust upon methe ape inTarzan,Mr. Crabtree inThe Rover Boys, Mr. Damon inTom Swift. Thus we came to know Dill as a pocket Merlin, whose head teemed with eccentric plans, strange longings, and quaint fancies. But by the end of August our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions, and it was then that Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out. The Radley Place fascinated Dill. In spite of our warnings and explanations it drew him as the moon draws water, but drew him no nearer than the light-pole on the corner, a safe distance from the Radley gate. There he would stand, his arm around the fat pole, staring and wondering. The Radley Place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house. Walking south, one faced its porch; the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot. The house was low, was once white with a deep front porch and green shutters, but had long ago darkened to the color of the slate-gray yard around it. Rain-rotted shingles drooped over the eaves of the veranda; oak trees kept the sun away. The remains of a picket drunkenly guarded the front yarda swept yard that was never sweptwhere johnson grass and rabbit- tobacco grew in abundance. Inside the house lived a malevolent phantom. People said he existed, but Jem and I had never seen him. People said he went out at night when the moon was down, and peeped in windows. When peoples azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was because he had breathed on them. Any stealthy small crimes committed in Maycomb were his work. Once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid nocturnal events: peoples chickens and household pets were found mutilated; although the culprit was Crazy Addie, who eventually drowned himself in Barkers Eddy, people still looked at the Radley Place, unwilling to discard their initial suspicions. A Negro would not pass the Radley Place at night, he would cut across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked. The Maycomb school grounds adjoined the back of the Radley lot; from the Radley chickenyard tall pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard, but the nuts lay untouched by the children: Radley pecans would kill you. A baseball hit into the Radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked. The misery of that house began many years before Jem and I were born. The Radleys, welcome anywhere in town, kept to themselves, a predilection unforgivable in Maycomb. They did not go to church, Maycombs principal recreation, but worshiped at home;Mrs.Radleyseldomifevercrossedthestreetforamid-morningcoffeebreakwith her neighbors, and certainly never joined a missionary circle. Mr. Radley walked to town at eleven-thirty every morning and came back promptly at twelve, sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries. I never knew how old Mr. Radley made his livingJem said he bought cotton, a polite term for doing nothingbut Mr. Radley and his wife had lived there with their two sons as long as anybody could remember. The shutters and doors of the Radley house were closed on Sundays, another thing alien to Maycombs ways: closed doors meant illness and cold weather only. Of all days Sunday was the day for formal afternoon visiting: ladies wore corsets, men wore coats, children wore shoes. But to climb the Radley front steps and call, He-y, of a Sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did. The Radley house had no screen doors. I once asked Atticus if it ever had any; Atticus said yes, but before I was born. According to neighborhood legend, when the younger Radley boy was in his teens he became acquainted with some of the Cunninghams from Old Sarum, an enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county, and they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in Maycomb. They did little, but enough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits: they hung around the barbershop; they rode the bus to Abbottsville on Sundays and went to the picture show; they attended dances at the countys riverside gambling hell, the Dew-Drop Inn & Fishing Camp; they experimented with stumphole whiskey. Nobody in Maycomb had nerve enough to tell Mr. Radley that his boy was in with the wrong crowd. One night, in an excessive spurt of high spirits, the boys backed around the square in a borrowed flivver, resisted arrest by Maycombs ancient beadle, Mr. Conner, and locked him in the courthouse outhouse. The town decided something had to be done; Mr. Conner said he knew who each and every one of them was, and he was bound and determined they wouldnt get away with it, so the boys came before the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, assault and battery, and using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female. The judge askedMr.Connerwhyheincludedthelastcharge;Mr.Connersaidtheycussedsoloud he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard them. The judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school, where boys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and decent shelter: it was no prison and it was no disgrace. Mr. Radley thought it was. If the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radley would see to it that Arthur gave no further trouble. Knowing that Mr. Radleys word was his bond, the judge was gla
 to do so. The other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary education to be had in the state; one of them eventually worked his way through engineering school at Auburn. The doors of the Radley house were closed on weekdays as well as Sundays, and Mr. Radleys boy was not seen again for fifteen years. But there came a day, barely within Jems memory, when Boo Radley was heard from and was seen by several people, but not by Jem. He said Atticus never talked much about the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticuss only answer was for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a right to; but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, Mm, mm, mm. So Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, a neighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss Stephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items fromThe Maycomb Tribuneto paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr. Radley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parents leg, pulled them out, wiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities. Mrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but when the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the Tribune. He was thirty-three years old then. Miss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum, when it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo wasnt crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr. Radley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not a criminal. The sheriff hadnt the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so Boo was locked in the courthouse basement. Boos transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jems memory. Miss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he didnt take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could not live forever on the bounty of the county. Nobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep Boo out of sight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained to the bed most of the time. Atticus said no, it wasnt that sort of thing, that there were other ways of making people into ghosts. My memory came alive to see Mrs. Radley occasionally open the front door, walk to the edge of the porch, and pour water on her cannas. But every day Jem and I would see Mr. Radley walking to and from town. He was a thin leathery man with colorless eyes, so colorless they did not reflect light. His cheekbones were sharp and his mouth was wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss Stephanie Crawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as his only law, and we believed her, because Mr. Radleys posture was ramrod straight. He never spoke to us. When he passed we would look at the ground and say, Good morning, sir, and he would cough in reply. Mr. Radleys elder son lived in Pensacola; he came home at Christmas, and he was one of the few persons we ever saw enter or leave the place. From the day Mr. Radley took Arthur home, people said the house died. But there came a day when Atticus told us hed wear us out if we made any noise in the yard and commissioned Calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a sound out of us. Mr. Radley was dying. He took his time about it. Wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the Radley lot, straw was put down on the sidewalk, traffic was diverted to the back street. Dr. Reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the Radleys every time he called. Jem and I crept around the yard for days. At last the sawhorses were taken away, and we stood watching from the front porch when Mr. Radley made his final journey past our house. There goes the meanest man ever God blew breath into, murmured Calpurnia, and she spat meditatively into the yard. We looked at her in surprise, for Calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people. The neighborhood thought when Mr. Radley went under Boo would come out, but it had another think coming: Boos elder brother returned from Pensacola and took Mr. Radleys place. The only difference between him and his father was their ages. Jem said Mr. Nathan Radley bought cotton, too. Mr. Nathan would speak to us, however, when we said good morning, and sometimes we saw him coming from town with a magazine in his hand. The more we told Dill about the Radleys, the more he wanted to know, the longer he would stand hugging the light-pole on the corner, the more he would wonder. Wonder what he does in there, he would murmur. Looks like hed just stick his head out the door. Jem said, He goes out, all right, when its pitch dark. Miss Stephanie Crawford said she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight through the window at her said his head was like a skull lookin at her. Aint you ever waked up at night and heard him, Dill? He walks like this- Jem slid his feet through the gravel. Why do you think Miss Rachel locks up so tight at night? Ive seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin, and one night I heard him scratching on the back screen, but he was gone time Atticus gotthere. Wonder what he looks like? said Dill. Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo: Boo was about six-and-a-half feet tall, judging from his tracks; he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch, thats why his hands were bloodstainedif you ate an animal raw, you could never wash the blood off. There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face; what teeth he had were yellow and rotten; his eyes popped, and he drooled most of the time. Lets try to make him come out, said Dill. Id like to see what he looks like. Jem said if Dill wanted to get himself killed, all he had to do was go up and knock on the front door. Our first raid came to pass only because Dill bet JemThe Gray Ghostagainst two Tom Swifts that Jem wouldnt get any farther than the Radley gate. In all his life, Jem had never declined a dare. Jem thought about it for three days. I suppose he loved honor more than his head, for Dill wore him down easily: Youre scared, Dill said, the first day. Aint scared, just respectful, Jem said. The next day Dill said, Youre too scared even to put your big toe in the front yard. Jem said he reckoned he wasnt, hed passed the Radley Place every school day of his life. Always runnin, I said. But Dill got him the third day, when he told Jem that folks in Meridian certainly werent as afraid as the folks in Maycomb, that hed never seen such scary folks as the ones in Maycomb. This was enough to make Jem march to the corner, where he stopped and leaned against the light-pole, watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge. I hope youve got it through your head that hell kill us each and every one, Dill Harris, said Jem, when we joined him. Dont blame me when he gouges your eyes out. You started it, remember. Youre still scared, murmured Dill patiently. Jem wanted Dill to know once and for all that he wasnt scared of anything: Its just that I cant think of a way to make him come out without him gettin us. Besides, Jem had his little sister to think of. When he said that, I knew he was afraid. Jem had his little sister to think of the time I dared him to jump off the top of the house: If I got killed, whatd become of you? he asked. Then he jumped, landed unhurt, and his sense of responsibility left him until confronted by the Radley Place. You gonna run out on a dare? asked Dill. If you are, then- Dill, you have to think about these things, Jem said. Lemme think a minute its sort of like making a turtle come out Hows that? asked Dill. Strike a match under him. I told Jem if he set fire to the Radley house I was going to tell Atticus on him. Dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful. Aint hateful, just persuades hims not like youd chunk him in the fire, Jem growled. How do you know a match dont hurt him? Turtles cant feel, stupid, said Jem. Were you ever a turtle, huh? My stars, Dill! Now lemme think reckon we can rock him Jem stood in thought so long that Dill made a mild concession: I wont say you ran out on a dare an Ill swap youThe Gray Ghostif you just go up and touch the house. Jem brightened. Touch the house, that all? Dill nodded. Sure thats all, now? I dont want you hollerin something different the minute I get back. Yeah, thats all, said Dill. Hell probably come out after you when he sees you in the yard, then Scoutn mell jump on him and hold him down till we can tell him we aint gonna hurt him. We left the corner, crossed the side street that ran in front of the Radley house, and stopped at the gate. Well go on, said Dill, Scout and mes right behind you. Im going, said Jem, dont hurry me. He walked to the corner of the lot, then back again, studying the simple terrain as if deciding how best to effect an entry, frowning and scratching his head. Then I sneered at him. Jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house, slapped it with his palm and ran back past us, not waiting to see if his foray was successful. Dill and I followed on his heels. Safely on our porch, panting and out of breath, we looked back. The old house was the same, droopy and sick, but as we stared down the street we thought we saw an inside shutter move. Flick. A tiny, almost invisible movement, and the house was still.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch1,"Scout Finch is growing up in a hot, tired Alabama town, where there is nothing to buy and nothing to buy it with. She and her older brother, Jem, live with their father, Atticus, the local lawyer, and their cook, Calpurnia, close to downtown Maycomb. They're all related by blood or marriage to everyone in town, so it's a close-knit group to say the least. As our story begins, summer has just started. Scout is six, and Jem is ten, and they have just discovered a boy hiding in their next door neighbors turnip greens. He's a scrawny kid who's name is Dill, and the three become instant friends as soon as it's revealed that Dill has already seen ""Dracula"", which gives him instant credibility. As summer progresses and favorite games become old hat, Scout, Jem, and Dill become obsessed with making Boo Radley come out. Boo Radley lives up the street from Scout and Jem, and legend has it that he never comes out of his house. Any small crimes or mysterious happenings in town are said to be his work, and rarely will anyone pass the house alone at night. Their first raid consists of a dare between Dill and Jem. He must run to the Radley house, touch it, and run back. He finally does it, but only after 3 days careful thought and much ribbing from Dill."
"Dill left us early in September, to return to Meridian. We saw him off on the five oclock bus and I was miserable without him until it occurred to me that I would be starting to school in a week. I never looked forward more to anything in my life. Hours of wintertime had found me in the treehouse, looking over at the schoolyard, spying on multitudes of children through a two-power telescope Jem had given me, learning their games, following Jems red jacket through wriggling circles of blind mans buff, secretly sharing their misfortunes and minor victories. I longed to join them. Jem condescended to take me to school the first day, a job usually done by ones parents, but Atticus had said Jem would be delighted to show me where my room was. I think some money changed hands in this transaction, for as we trotted around the corner past the Radley Place I heard an unfamiliar jingle in Jems pockets. When we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard, Jem was careful to explain that during school hours I was not to bother him, I was not to approach him with requests to enact a chapter of Tarzan and the Ant Men, to embarrass him with references to his private life, or tag along behind him at recess and noon. I was to stick with the first grade andhe would stick with the fifth. In short, I was to leave him alone. You mean we cant play any more? I asked. Well do like we always do at home, he said, but youll seeschools different. It certainly was. Before the first morning was over, Miss Caroline Fisher, our teacher, hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand with a ruler, then made me stand in the corner until noon. Miss Caroline was no more than twenty-one. She had bright auburn hair, pink cheeks, and wore crimson fingernail polish. She also wore high-heeled pumps and a red-and- white-striped dress. She looked and smelled like a peppermint drop. She boarded across the street one door down from us in Miss Maudie Atkinsons upstairs front room, and when Miss Maudie introduced us to her, Jem was in a haze for days. Miss Caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said, This says I am Miss Caroline Fisher. I am from North Alabama, from Winston County. The class murmured apprehensively, should she prove to harbor her share of the peculiarities indigenous to that region. (When Alabama seceded from the Union on January 11, 1861, Winston County seceded from Alabama, and every child in Maycomb County knew it.) North Alabama was full of Liquor Interests, Big Mules, steel companies, Republicans, professors, and other persons of no background. Miss Caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats. The cats had long conversations with one another, they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a warm house beneath a kitchen stove. By the time Mrs. Cat called the drugstore for an order of chocolate malted mice the class was wriggling like a bucketful of catawba worms. Miss Caroline seemed unaware that the ragged, denim-shirted and floursack-skirted first grade, most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hogs from the time they were able to walk, were immune to imaginative literature. Miss Caroline came to the end of the story and said, Oh, my, wasnt that nice? Then she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous square capitals, turned to the class and asked, Does anybody know what these are? Everybody did; most of the first grade had failed it last year. I suppose she chose me because she knew my name; as I read the alphabet a faint line appeared between her eyebrows, and after making me read most ofMy FirstReaderand the stock-market quotations fromThe Mobile Registeraloud, she discovered that I was literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste. Miss Caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, it would interfere with my reading. Teach me? I said in surprise. He hasnt taught me anything, Miss Caroline. Atticus aint got time to teach me anything, I added, when Miss Caroline smiled and shook her head. Why, hes so tired at night he just sits in the livingroom and reads. If he didnt teach you, who did? Miss Caroline asked good-naturedly. Somebody did. You werent born readingThe Mobile Register. Jem says I was. He read in a book where I was a Bullfinch instead of a Finch. Jem says my names really Jean Louise Bullfinch, that I got swapped when I was born and Im really a- Miss Caroline apparently thought I was lying. Lets not let our imaginations run away with us, dear, she said. Now you tell your father not to teach you any more. Its best to begin reading with a fresh mind. You tell him Ill take over from here and try to undo the damage- Maam? Your father does not know how to teach. You can have a seat now. I mumbled that I was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime. I never deliberately learned to read, but somehow I had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers. In the long hours of churchwas it then I learned? I could not remember not being able to read hymns. Now that I was compelled to think about it, reading was something that just came to me, as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit without looking around, or achieving two bows from a snarl of shoelaces. I could not remember when the lines above Atticuss moving finger separated into words, but I had stared at them all the evenings in my memory, listening to the news of the day, Bills to Be Enacted into Laws, the diaries of Lorenzo Dowanything Atticus happened to be reading when I crawled into his lap every night. Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing. I knew I had annoyed Miss Caroline, so I let well enough alone and stared out the window until recess when Jem cut me from the covey of first-graders in the schoolyard. He asked how I was getting along. I told him. If I didnt have to stay Id leave. Jem, that damn lady says Atticuss been teaching me to read and for him to stop it- Dont worry, Scout, Jem comforted me. Our teacher says Miss Carolines introducing a new way of teaching. She learned about it in college. Itll be in all the grades soon. You dont have to learn much out of books that wayits like if you wanta learn about cows, you go milk one, see? Yeah Jem, but I dont wanta study cows, I- Sure you do. You hafta know about cows, theyre a big part of life in Maycomb County. I contented myself with asking Jem if hed lost his mind. Im just trying to tell you the new way theyre teachin the first grade, stubborn. Its the Dewey Decimal System. Having never questioned Jems pronouncements, I saw no reason to begin now. The Dewey Decimal System consisted, in part, of Miss Caroline waving cards at us on which were printed the, cat, rat, man, and you. No comment seemed to be expected of us, and the class received these impressionistic revelations in silence. I was bored, so I began a letter to Dill. Miss Caroline caught me writing and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me. Besides, she said. We dont write in the first grade, we print. You wont learn to write until youre in the third grade. Calpurnia was to blame for this. It kept me from driving her crazy on rainy days, I guess. She would set me a writing task by scrawling the alphabet firmly across the top of a tablet, then copying out a chapter of the Bible beneath. If I reproduced her penmanship satisfactorily, she rewarded me with an open-faced sandwich of bread and butter and sugar. In Calpurnias teaching, there was no sentimentality: I seldom pleased her and she seldom rewarded me. Everybody who goes home to lunch hold up your hands, said Miss Caroline, breaking into my new grudge against Calpurnia. The town children did so, and she looked us over. Everybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk. Molasses buckets appeared from nowhere, and the ceiling danced with metallic light. Miss Caroline walked up and down the rows peering and poking into lunch containers, nodding if the contents pleased her, frowning a little at others. She stopped at Walter Cunninghams desk. Wheres yours? she asked. Walter Cunninghams face told everybody in the first grade he had hookworms. His absence of shoes told us how he got them. People caught hookworms going barefooted in barnyards and hog wallows. If Walter had owned any shoes he would have worn them the first day of school and then discarded them until mid-winter. He did have on a clean shirt and neatly mendedoveralls. Did you forget your lunch this morning? asked Miss Caroline. Walter looked straight ahead. I saw a muscle jump in his skinny jaw. Did you forget it this morning? asked Miss Caroline. Walters jaw twitched again. Yebm, he finally mumbled. Miss Caroline went to her desk and opened her purse. Heres a quarter, she said to Walter. Go and eat downtown today. You can pay me back tomorrow. Walter shook his head. Nome thank you maam, he drawled softly. Impatience crept into Miss Carolines voice: Here Walter, come get it. Walter shook his head again. When Walter shook his head a third time someone whispered, Go on and tell her, Scout. I turned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus delegation looking at me. Miss Caroline and I had conferred twice already, and they were looking at me in the innocent assurance that familiarity breedsunderstanding. I rose graciously on Walters behalf: AhMiss Caroline? What is it, Jean Louise? Miss Caroline, hes a Cunningham. I sat back down. What, Jean Louise? I thought I had made things sufficiently clear. It was clear enough to the rest of us: Walter Cunningham was sitting there lying his head off. He didnt forget his lunch, he didnt have any. He had none today nor would he have any tomorrow or the next day. He had probably never seen three quarters together at the same time in his life. I tried again: Walters one of the Cunninghams, Miss Caroline. I beg your pardon, Jean Louise? Thats okay, maam, youll get to know all the county folks after a while. The Cunninghams never took anything they cant pay backno church baskets and no scrip stamps. They never took anything off of anybody, they get along on what they have. They dont have much, but they get along on it. My special knowledge of the Cunningham tribeone branch, that iswas gained from events of last winter. Walters father was one of Atticuss clients. After a dreary conversation in our livingroom one night about his entailment, before Mr. Cunningham left he said, Mr. Finch, I dont know when Ill ever be able to pay you. Let that be the least of your worries, Walter, Atticus said. When I asked Jem what entailment was, and Jem described it as a condition of having your tail in a crack, I asked Atticus if Mr. Cunningham would ever pay us. Not in money, Atticus said, but before the years out Ill have been paid. You watch. We watched. One morning Jem and I found a load of stovewood in the back yard. Later, a sack of hickory nuts appeared on the back steps. With Christmas came a crate of smilax and holly. That spring when we found a crokersack full of turnip greens, Atticus said Mr. Cunningham had more than paid him. Why does he pay you like that? I asked. Because thats the only way he can pay me. He has no money. Are we poor, Atticus? Atticus nodded. We are indeed. Jems nose wrinkled. Are we as poor as the Cunninghams? Not exactly. The Cunninghams are country folks, farmers, and the crash hit them hardest. Atticus said professional people were poor because the farmers were poor. As Maycomb County was farm country, nickels and dimes were hard to come by for doctors and dentists and lawyers. Entailment was only a part of Mr. Cunninghams vexations. The acres not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt, and the little cash he made went to interest. If he held his mouth right, Mr. Cunningham could get a WPA job, but his land would go to ruin if he left it, and he was willing to go hungry to keep his land and vote as he pleased. Mr. Cunningham, said Atticus, came from a set breed of men. As the Cunninghams had no money to pay a lawyer, they simply paid us with what they had. Did you know, said Atticus, that Dr. Reynolds works the same way? He charges some folks a bushel of potatoes for delivery of a baby. Miss Scout, if you give me your attention Ill tell you what entailment is. Jems definitions are very nearly accurate sometimes. If I could have explained these things to Miss Caroline, I would have saved myself some inconvenience and Miss Caroline subsequent mortification, but it was beyond my ability to explain things as well as Atticus, so I said, Youre shamin him, Miss Caroline. Walter hasnt got a quarter at home to bring you, and you cant use any stovewood. Miss Caroline stood stock still, then grabbed me by the collar and hauled me back to her desk. Jean Louise, Ive had about enough of you this morning, she said. Youre starting off on the wrong foot in every way, my dear. Hold out your hand. I thought she was going to spit in it, which was the only reason anybody in Maycomb held out his hand: it was a time-honored method of sealing oral contracts. Wondering what bargain we had made, I turned to the class for an answer, but the class looked back at me in puzzlement. Miss Caroline picked up her ruler, gave me half a dozen quick little pats, then told me to stand in the corner. A storm of laughter broke loose when it finally occurred to the class that Miss Caroline had whipped me. When Miss Caroline threatened it with a similar fate the first grade exploded again, becoming cold sober only when the shadow of Miss Blount fell over them. Miss Blount, a native Maycombian as yet uninitiated in the mysteries of the Decimal System, appeared at the door hands on hips and announced: If I hear another sound from this room Ill burn up everybody in it. Miss Caroline, the sixth grade cannot concentrate on the pyramids for all this racket! My sojourn in the corner was a short one. Saved by the bell, Miss Caroline watched the class file out for lunch. As I was the last to leave, I saw her sink down into her chair and bury her head in her arms. Had her conduct been more friendly toward me, I would have felt sorry for her. She was a pretty little thing.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch2,"When September rolls around and Dill leaves to go back home to Meridian, Scout realizes that she's starting her first year of school. After her first day, however, she's determined not to go back. After trying to explain the complicated backgrounds of some of the county folks to the new teacher, Scout lands herself into trouble again and again, and is not quite sure how. It should be obvious, she thinks, that offering Walter Cunningham a quarter for lunch is simply not done. They don't take help from anyone, and the reason why he doesn't have a lunch is because he can't afford one. When she tries to explain this to the new teacher, however, she gets her hands slapped by a ruler. When lunchtime finally rolls around, she's grateful to get out of class and go home."
"Catching Walter Cunningham in the schoolyard gave me some pleasure, but when I was rubbing his nose in the dirt Jem came by and told me to stop. Youre biggern he is, he said. Hes as old as you, nearly, I said. He made me start off on the wrong foot. Let him go, Scout. Why? He didnt have any lunch, I said, and explained my involvement in Walters dietary affairs. Walter had picked himself up and was standing quietly listening to Jem and me. His fists were half cocked, as if expecting an onslaught from both of us. I stomped at him to chase him away, but Jem put out his hand and stopped me. He examined Walter with an air of speculation. Your daddy Mr. Walter Cunningham from Old Sarum? he asked, and Walter nodded. Walter looked as if he had been raised on fish food: his eyes, as blue as Dill Harriss, were red-rimmed and watery. There was no color in his face except at the tip of his nose, which was moistly pink. He fingered the straps of his overalls, nervously picking at the metal hooks. Jem suddenly grinned at him. Come on home to dinner with us, Walter, he said. Wed be glad to have you. Walters face brightened, then darkened. Jem said, Our daddys a friend of your daddys. Scout here, shes crazyshe wont fight you any more. I wouldnt be too certain of that, I said. Jems free dispensation of my pledge irked me, but precious noontime minutes were ticking away. Yeah Walter, I wont jump on you again. Dont you like butterbeans? Our Cals a real good cook. Walter stood where he was, biting his lip. Jem and I gave up, and we were nearly to the Radley Place when Walter called, Hey, Im comin! When Walter caught up with us, Jem made pleasant conversation with him. A haint lives there, he said cordially, pointing to the Radley house. Ever hear about him, Walter? Reckon I have, said Walter. Almost died first year I come to school and et them pecansfolks say he pizened em and put em over on the school side of the fence. Jem seemed to have little fear of Boo Radley now that Walter and I walked beside him. Indeed, Jem grew boastful: I went all the way up to the house once, he said to Walter. Anybody who went up to the house once oughta not to still run every time he passes it, I said to the clouds above. And whos runnin, Miss Priss? You are, when aint anybody with you. By the time we reached our front steps Walter had forgotten he was a Cunningham. Jem ran to the kitchen and asked Calpurnia to set an extra plate, we had company. Atticus greeted Walter and began a discussion about crops neither Jem nor I could follow. Reason I cant pass the first grade, Mr. Finch, is Ive had to stay out ever spring an help Papa with the choppin, but theres anothern at the house now thats field size. Did you pay a bushel of potatoes for him? I asked, but Atticus shook his head at me. While Walter piled food on his plate, he and Atticus talked together like two men, to the wonderment of Jem and me. Atticus was expounding upon farm problems when Walter interrupted to ask if there was any molasses in the house. Atticus summoned Calpurnia, who returned bearing the syrup pitcher. She stood waiting for Walter to help himself. Walter poured syrup on his vegetables and meat with a generous hand. He would probably have poured it into his milk glass had I not asked what the sam hill he was doing. The silver saucer clattered when he replaced the pitcher, and he quickly put his hands in his lap. Then he ducked his head. Atticus shook his head at me again. But hes gone and drowned his dinner in syrup, I protested. Hes poured it all over- It was then that Calpurnia requested my presence in the kitchen. She was furious, and when she was furious Calpurnias grammar became erratic. When in tranquility, her grammar was as good as anybodys in Maycomb. Atticus said Calpurnia had more education than most colored folks. When she squinted down at me the tiny lines around her eyes deepened. Theres some folks who dont eat like us, she whispered fiercely, but you aint called on to contradict em at the table when they dont. That boys yo compny and if he wants to eat up the table cloth you let him, you hear? He aint company, Cal, hes just a Cunningham- Hush your mouth! Dont matter who they are, anybody sets foot in this houses yo compny, and dont you let me catch you remarkin on their ways like you was so high and mighty! Yo folks might be bettern the Cunninghams but it dont count for nothin the way youre disgracin emif you cant act fit to eat at the table you can just set here and eat in the kitchen! Calpurnia sent me through the swinging door to the diningroom with a stinging smack. I retrieved my plate and finished dinner in the kitchen, thankful, though, that I was spared the humiliation of facing them again. I told Calpurnia to just wait, Id fix her: one of these days when she wasnt looking Id go off and drown myself in Barkers Eddy and then shed be sorry. Besides, I added, shed already gotten me in trouble once today: she had taught me to write and it was all her fault. Hush your fussin, she said. Jem and Walter returned to school ahead of me: staying behind to advise Atticus of Calpurnias iniquities was worth a solitary sprint past the Radley Place. She likes Jem bettern she likes me, anyway, I concluded, and suggested that Atticus lose no time in packing her off. Have you ever considered that Jem doesnt worry her half as much? Atticuss voice was flinty. Ive no intention of getting rid of her, now or ever. We couldnt operate a single day without Cal, have you ever thought of that? You think about how much Cal does for you, and you mind her, you hear? I returned to school and hated Calpurnia steadily until a sudden shriek shattered my resentments. I looked up to see Miss Caroline standing in the middle of the room, sheer horror flooding her face. Apparently she had revived enough to persevere in her profession. Its alive! she screamed. The male population of the class rushed as one to her assistance. Lord, I thought, shes scared of a mouse. Little Chuck Little, whose patience with all living things was phenomenal, said, Which way did he go, Miss Caroline? Tell us where he went, quick! D.C.- he turned to a boy behind himD.C., shut the door and well catch him. Quick, maam, whered he go? Miss Caroline pointed a shaking finger not at the floor nor at a desk, but to a hulking individual unknown to me. Little Chucks face contracted and he said gently, You mean him, maam? Yessum, hes alive. Did he scare you some way? Miss Caroline said desperately, I was just walking by when it crawled out of his hair just crawled out of his hair- Little Chuck grinned broadly. There aint no need to fear a cootie, maam. Aint you ever seen one? Now dont you be afraid, you just go back to your desk and teach us some more. Little Chuck Little was another member of the population who didnt know where his next meal was coming from, but he was a born gentleman. He put his hand under her elbow and led Miss Caroline to the front of the room. Now dont you fret, maam, he said. There aint no need to fear a cootie. Ill just fetch you some cool water. The cooties host showed not the faintest interest in the furor he had wrought. He searched the scalp above his forehead, located his guest and pinched it between his thumb and forefinger. Miss Caroline watched the process in horrid fascination. Little Chuck brought water in a paper cup, and she drank it gratefully. Finally she found her voice. What is your name, son? she asked softly. The boy blinked. Who, me? Miss Caroline nodded. Burris Ewell. Miss Caroline inspected her roll-book. I have a Ewell here, but I dont have a first name would you spell your first name for me? Dont know how. They call me Burrist home. Well, Burris, said Miss Caroline, I think wed better excuse you for the rest of the afternoon. I want you to go home and wash your hair. From her desk she produced a thick volume, leafed through its pages and read for a moment. A good home remedy forBurris, I want you to go home and wash your hair with lye soap. When youve done that, treat your scalp with kerosene. What fer, missus? To get rid of theer, cooties. You see, Burris, the other children might catch them, and you wouldnt want that, would you? The boy stood up. He was the filthiest human I had ever seen. His neck was dark gray, the backs of his hands were rusty, and his fingernails were black deep into the quick. He peered at Miss Caroline from a fist-sized clean space on his face. No one had noticed him, probably, because Miss Caroline and I had entertained the class most of the morning. And Burris, said Miss Caroline, please bathe yourself before you come back tomorrow. The boy laughed rudely. You aint sendin me home, missus. I was on the verge of leavinI done done my time for this year. Miss Caroline looked puzzled. What do you mean by that? The boy did not answer. He gave a short contemptuous snort. One of the elderly members of the class answered her: Hes one of the Ewells, maam, and I wondered if this explanation would be as unsuccessful as my attempt. But Miss Caroline seemed willing to listen. Whole schools full of em. They come first day every year and then leave. The truant lady gets em here cause she threatens em with the sheriff, but shes give up tryin to hold em. She reckons shes carried out the law just gettin their names on the roll and runnin em here the first day. Youre supposed to mark em absent the rest of theyear But what about their parents? asked Miss Caroline, in genuine concern. Aint got no mother, was the answer, and their paws right contentious. Burris Ewell was flattered by the recital. Been comin to the first day o the first grade fer three year now, he said expansively. Reckon if Im smart this year theyll promote me to the second Miss Caroline said, Sit back down, please, Burris, and the moment she said it I knew she had made a serious mistake. The boys condescension flashed to anger. You try and make me, missus. Little Chuck Little got to his feet. Let him go, maam, he said. Hes a mean one, a hard-down mean one. Hes liable to start somethin, and theres some little folks here. He was among the most diminutive of men, but when Burris Ewell turned toward him, Little Chucks right hand went to his pocket. Watch your step, Burris, he said. Id soons kill you as look at you. Now go home. Burris seemed to be afraid of a child half his height, and Miss Caroline took advantage of his indecision: Burris, go home. If you dont Ill call the principal, she said. Ill have to report this,anyway. The boy snorted and slouched leisurely to the door. Safely out of range, he turned and shouted: Report and be damned to ye! Aint no snot-nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born cn make me do nothin! You aint makin me go nowhere, missus. You just remember that, you aint makin me go nowhere! He waited until he was sure she was crying, then he shuffled out of the building. Soon we were clustered around her desk, trying in our various ways to comfort her. He was a real mean one below the belt you aint called on to teach folks like that them aint Maycombs ways, Miss Caroline, not really now dont you fret, maam. Miss Caroline, why dont you read us a story? That cat thing was real fine this mornin Miss Caroline smiled, blew her nose, said, Thank you, darlings, dispersed us, opened a book and mystified the first grade with a long narrative about a toadfrog that lived in ahall. When I passed the Radley Place for the fourth time that daytwice at a full gallop my gloom had deepened to match the house. If the remainder of the school year were as fraught with drama as the first day, perhaps it would be mildly entertaining, but the prospect of spending nine months refraining from reading and writing made me think of runningaway. By late afternoon most of my traveling plans were complete; when Jem and I raced each other up the sidewalk to meet Atticus coming home from work, I didnt give him much of a race. It was our habit to run meet Atticus the moment we saw him round the post office corner in the distance. Atticus seemed to have forgotten my noontime fall from grace; he was full of questions about school. My replies were monosyllabic and he did not press me. Perhaps Calpurnia sensed that my day had been a grim one: she let me watch her fix supper. Shut your eyes and open your mouth and Ill give you a surprise, she said. It was not often that she made crackling bread, she said she never had time, but with both of us at school today had been an easy one for her. She knew I loved crackling bread. I missed you today, she said. The house got so lonesome long about two oclock I had to turn on the radio. Why? Jemn me aint ever in the house unless its rainin. I know, she said, But one of yous always in callin distance. I wonder how much of the day I spend just callin after you. Well, she said, getting up from the kitchen chair, its enough time to make a pan of cracklin bread, I reckon. You run along now and let me get supper on the table. Calpurnia bent down and kissed me. I ran along, wondering what had come over her. She had wanted to make up with me, that was it. She had always been too hard on me, she had at last seen the error of her fractious ways, she was sorry and too stubborn to say so. I was weary from the days crimes. After supper, Atticus sat down with the paper and called, Scout, ready to read? The Lord sent me more than I could bear, and I went to the front porch. Atticus followed me. Something wrong, Scout? I told Atticus I didnt feel very well and didnt think Id go to school any more if it was all right with him. Atticus sat down in the swing and crossed his legs. His fingers wandered to his watchpocket; he said that was the only way he could think. He waited in amiable silence, and I sought to reinforce my position: You never went to school and you do all right, so Ill just stay home too. You can teach me like Granddaddy taught you n Uncle Jack. No I cant, said Atticus. I have to make a living. Besides, theyd put me in jail if I kept you at homedose of magnesia for you tonight and school tomorrow. Im feeling all right, really. Thought so. Now whats the matter? Bit by bit, I told him the days misfortunes. -and she said you taught me all wrong, so we cant ever read any more, ever. Please dont send me back, please sir. Atticus stood up and walked to the end of the porch. When he completed his examination of the wisteria vine he strolled back to me. First of all, he said, if you can learn a simple trick, Scout, youll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view- Sir? -until you climb into his skin and walk around in it. Atticus said I had learned many things today, and Miss Caroline had learned several things herself. She had learned not to hand something to a Cunningham, for one thing, but if Walter and I had put ourselves in her shoes wed have seen it was an honest mistake on her part. We could not expect her to learn all Maycombs ways in one day, and we could not hold her responsible when she knew no better. Ill be dogged, I said. I didnt know no better than not to read to her, and she held me responsiblelisten Atticus, I dont have to go to school! I was bursting with a sudden thought. Burris Ewell, remember? He just goes to school the first day. The truant lady reckons shes carried out the law when she gets his name on the roll- You cant do that, Scout, Atticus said. Sometimes its better to bend the law a little in special cases. In your case, the law remains rigid. So to school you must go. I dont see why I have to when he doesnt. Then listen. Atticus said the Ewells had been the disgrace of Maycomb for three generations. None of them had done an honest days work in his recollection. He said that some Christmas, when he was getting rid of the tree, he would take me with him and show me where and how they lived. They were people, but they lived like anim
ls. They can go to school any time they want to, when they show the faintest symptom of wanting an education, said Atticus. There are ways of keeping them in school by force, but its silly to force people like the Ewells into a newenvironment- If I didnt go to school tomorrow, youd force me to. Let us leave it at this, said Atticus dryly. You, Miss Scout Finch, are of the common folk. You must obey the law. He said that the Ewells were members of an exclusive society made up of Ewells. In certain circumstances the common folk judiciously allowed them certain privileges by the simple method of becoming blind to some of the Ewells activities. They didnt have to go to school, for one thing. Another thing, Mr. Bob Ewell, Burriss father, was permitted to hunt and trap out of season. Atticus, thats bad, I said. In Maycomb County, hunting out of season was a misdemeanor at law, a capital felony in the eyes of the populace. Its against the law, all right, said my father, and its certainly bad, but when a man spends his relief checks on green whiskey his children have a way of crying from hunger pains. I dont know of any landowner around here who begrudges those children any game their father can hit. Mr. Ewell shouldnt do that- Of course he shouldnt, but hell never change his ways. Are you going to take out your disapproval on his children? No sir, I murmured, and made a final stand: But if I keep on goin to school, we cant ever read any more Thats really bothering you, isnt it? Yes sir. When Atticus looked down at me I saw the expression on his face that always made me expect something. Do you know what a compromise is? he asked. Bending the law? No, an agreement reached by mutual concessions. It works this way, he said. If youll concede the necessity of going to school, well go on reading every night just as we always have. Is it a bargain? Yes sir! Well consider it sealed without the usual formality, Atticus said, when he saw me preparing to spit. As I opened the front screen door Atticus said, By the way, Scout, youd better not say anything at school about our agreement. Why not? Im afraid our activities would be received with considerable disapprobation by the more learned authorities. Jem and I were accustomed to our fathers last-will-and-testament diction, and we were at all times free to interrupt Atticus for a translation when it was beyond our understanding. Huh, sir? I never went to school, he said, but I have a feeling that if you tell Miss Caroline we read every night shell get after me, and I wouldnt want her after me. Atticus kept us in fits that evening, gravely reading columns of print about a man who sat on a flagpole for no discernible reason, which was reason enough for Jem to spend the following Saturday aloft in the treehouse. Jem sat from after breakfast until sunset and would have remained overnight had not Atticus severed his supply lines. I had spent most of the day climbing up and down, running errands for him, providing him with literature, nourishment and water, and was carrying him blankets for the night when Atticus said if I paid no attention to him, Jem would come down. Atticus wasright.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch3,"Scout wastes no time paying back Walter Cunningham for getting her started on the wrong foot with the new teacher. It isn't until Jem comes and stops her that she quits tormenting him in the playground, and she nearly falls over when Jem invites the poor boy to lunch at their house. The day doesn't improve when she embarrasses Walter at the table and is forced to eat in the kitchen by Calpurnia. When she returns to school the day's drama isn't over. Miss Caroline, the teacher, is horrified to discover a cootie in the hair of Burris Ewell, a hulking, angry boy who quickly reduces Miss Caroline to tears as he slouches out of the room, his first and only day of school over. That evening Scout is weary from the day's crimes and begs Atticus not to send her back to school anymore. The fact that Miss Caroline forbade her to read and write anymore is really what's distressing her, and when Atticus strikes a deal with her that if she will concede to go back to school they'll continue reading together like always, she happily accepts."
"The remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the first. Indeed, they were an endless Project that slowly evolved into a Unit, in which miles of construction paper and wax crayon were expended by the State of Alabama in its well-meaning but fruitless efforts to teach me Group Dynamics. What Jem called the Dewey Decimal System was school-wide by the end of my first year, so I had no chance to compare it with other teaching techniques. I could only look around me: Atticus and my uncle, who went to school at home, knew everythingat least, what one didnt know the other did. Furthermore, I couldnt help noticing that my father had served for years in the state legislature, elected each time without opposition, innocent of the adjustments my teachers thought essential to the development of Good Citizenship. Jem, educated on a half-Decimal half-Duncecap basis, seemed to function effectively alone or in a group, but Jem was a poor example: no tutorial system devised by man could have stopped him from getting at books. As for me, I knew nothing except what I gathered fromTimemagazineand reading everything I could lay hands on at home, but as I inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the Maycomb County school system, I could not help receiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something. Out of what I knew not, yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me. As the year passed, released from school thirty minutes before Jem, who had to stay until three oclock, I ran by the Radley Place as fast as I could, not stopping until I reached the safety of our front porch. One afternoon as I raced by, something caught my eye and caught it in such a way that I took a deep breath, a long look around, and went back. Two live oaks stood at the edge of the Radley lot; their roots reached out into the side- road and made it bumpy. Something about one of the trees attracted my attention. Some tinfoil was sticking in a knot-hole just above my eye level, winking at me in the afternoon sun. I stood on tiptoe, hastily looked around once more, reached into the hole, and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers. My first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible, but I remembered where I was. I ran home, and on our front porch I examined my loot. The gum looked fresh. I sniffed it and it smelled all right. I licked it and waited for a while. When I did not die I crammed it into my mouth: Wrigleys Double-Mint. When Jem came home he asked me where I got such a wad. I told him I found it. Dont eat things you find, Scout. This wasnt on the ground, it was in a tree. Jem growled. Well it was, I said. It was sticking in that tree yonder, the one comin from school. Spit it out right now! I spat it out. The tang was fading, anyway. Ive been chewin it all afternoon and I aint dead yet, not even sick. Jem stamped his foot. Dont you know youre not supposed to even touch the trees over there? Youll get killed if you do! You touched the house once! That was different! You go gargleright now, you hear me? Aint neither, itll take the taste outa my mouth. You dont n Ill tell Calpurnia on you! Rather than risk a tangle with Calpurnia, I did as Jem told me. For some reason, my first year of school had wrought a great change in our relationship: Calpurnias tyranny, unfairness, and meddling in my business had faded to gentle grumblings of general disapproval. On my part, I went to much trouble, sometimes, not to provoke her. Summer was on the way; Jem and I awaited it with impatience. Summer was our best season: it was sleeping on the back screened porch in cots, or trying to sleep in the treehouse; summer was everything good to eat; it was a thousand colors in a parched landscape; but most of all, summer was Dill. The authorities released us early the last day of school, and Jem and I walked home together. Reckon old Dillll be coming home tomorrow, I said. Probably day after, said Jem. Missippi turns em loose a day later. As we came to the live oaks at the Radley Place I raised my finger to point for the hundredth time to the knot-hole where I had found the chewing gum, trying to make Jem believe I had found it there, and found myself pointing at another piece of tinfoil. I see it, Scout! I see it- Jem looked around, reached up, and gingerly pocketed a tiny shiny package. We ran home, and on the front porch we looked at a small box patchworked with bits of tinfoil collected from chewing-gum wrappers. It was the kind of box wedding rings came in, purple velvet with a minute catch. Jem flicked open the tiny catch. Inside were two scrubbed and polished pennies, one on top of the other. Jem examined them. Indian-heads, he said. Nineteen-six and Scout, one of ems nineteen-hundred. These are real old. Nineteen-hundred, I echoed. Say- Hush a minute, Im thinkin. Jem, you reckon thats somebodys hidin place? Naw, dont anybody much but us pass by there, unless its some grown persons- Grown folks dont have hidin places. You reckon we ought to keep em, Jem? I dont know what we could do, Scout. Whod we give em back to? I know for a fact dont anybody go by thereCecil goes by the back street an all the way around by town to get home. Cecil Jacobs, who lived at the far end of our street next door to the post office, walked a total of one mile per school day to avoid the Radley Place and old Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose. Mrs. Dubose lived two doors up the street from us; neighborhood opinion was unanimous that Mrs. Dubose was the meanest old woman who ever lived. Jem wouldnt go by her place without Atticus beside him. What you reckon we oughta do, Jem? Finders were keepers unless title was proven. Plucking an occasional camellia, getting a squirt of hot milk from Miss Maudie Atkinsons cow on a summer day, helping ourselves to someones scuppernongs was part of our ethical culture, but money was different. Tell you what, said Jem. Well keep em till school starts, then go around and ask everybody if theyre theirs. Theyre some bus childs, maybehe was too taken up with gettin outa school today an forgot em. These are somebodys, I know that. See how theyve been slicked up? Theyve been saved. Yeah, but why should somebody wanta put away chewing gum like that? You know it doesnt last. I dont know, Scout. But these are important to somebody Hows that, Jem? Well, Indian-headswell, they come from the Indians. Theyre real strong magic, they make you have good luck. Not like fried chicken when youre not lookin for it, but things like long life n good health, n passin six-weeks tests these are real valuable to somebody. Im gonna put em in my trunk. Before Jem went to his room, he looked for a long time at the Radley Place. He seemed to be thinking again. Two days later Dill arrived in a blaze of glory: he had ridden the train by himself from Meridian to Maycomb Junction (a courtesy titleMaycomb Junction was in Abbott County) where he had been met by Miss Rachel in Maycombs one taxi; he had eaten dinner in the diner, he had seen two twins hitched together get off the train in Bay St. Louis and stuck to his story regardless of threats. He had discarded the abominable blue shorts that were buttoned to his shirts and wore real short pants with a belt; he was somewhat heavier, no taller, and said he had seen his father. Dills father was taller than ours, he had a black beard (pointed), and was president of the L & NRailroad. I helped the engineer for a while, said Dill, yawning. In a pigs ear you did, Dill. Hush, said Jem. Whatll we play today? Tom and Sam and Dick, said Dill. Lets go in the front yard. Dill wanted the Rover Boys because there were three respectable parts. He was clearly tired of being our character man. Im tired of those, I said. I was tired of playing Tom Rover, who suddenly lost his memory in the middle of a picture show and was out of the script until the end, when he was found in Alaska. Make us up one, Jem, I said. Im tired of makin em up. Our first days of freedom, and we were tired. I wondered what the summer would bring. We had strolled to the front yard, where Dill stood looking down the street at the dreary face of the Radley Place. Ismelldeath, he said. I do, I mean it, he said, when I told him to shut up. You mean when somebodys dyin you can smell it? No, I mean I can smell somebody an tell if theyre gonna die. An old lady taught me how. Dill leaned over and sniffed me. JeanLouiseFinch, you are going to die in three days. Dill if you dont hush Ill knock you bowlegged. I mean it, now- Yawl hush, growled Jem, you act like you believe in Hot Steams. You act like you dont, I said. Whats a Hot Steam? asked Dill. Havent you ever walked along a lonesome road at night and passed by a hot place? Jem asked Dill. A Hot Steams somebody who cant get to heaven, just wallows around on lonesome roads an if you walk through him, when you die youll be one too, an youll go around at night suckin peoples breath- How can you keep from passing through one? You cant, said Jem. Sometimes they stretch all the way across the road, but if you hafta go through one you say, Angel-bright, life-in-death; get off the road, dont suck my breath. That keeps em from wrapping around you- Dont you believe a word he says, Dill, I said. Calpurnia says thats nigger-talk. Jem scowled darkly at me, but said, Well, are we gonna play anything or not? Lets roll in the tire, I suggested. Jem sighed. You know Im too big. You cn push. I ran to the back yard and pulled an old car tire from under the house. I slapped it up to the front yard. Im first, I said. Dill said he ought to be first, he just got here. Jem arbitrated, awarded me first push with an extra time for Dill, and I folded myself inside the tire. Until it happened I did not realize that Jem was offended by my contradicting him on Hot Steams, and that he was patiently awaiting an opportunity to reward me. He did, by pushing the tire down the sidewalk with all the force in his body. Ground, sky and houses melted into a mad palette, my ears throbbed, I was suffocating. I could not put out my hands to stop, they were wedged between my chest and knees. I could only hope that Jem would outrun the tire and me, or that I would be stopped by a bump in the sidewalk. I heard him behind me, chasing andshouting. The tire bumped on gravel, skeetered across the road, crashed into a barrier and popped me like a cork onto pavement. Dizzy and nauseated, I lay on the cement and shook my head still, pounded my ears to silence, and heard Jems voice: Scout, get away from there, come on! I raised my head and stared at the Radley Place steps in front of me. I froze. Come on, Scout, dont just lie there! Jem was screaming. Get up, cantcha? I got to my feet, trembling as I thawed. Get the tire! Jem hollered. Bring it with you! Aint you got any sense at all? When I was able to navigate, I ran back to them as fast as my shaking knees would carry me. Why didnt you bring it? Jem yelled. Why dontyouget it? I screamed. Jem was silent. Go on, it aint far inside the gate. Why, you even touched the house once, remember? Jem looked at me furiously, could not decline, ran down the sidewalk, treaded water at the gate, then dashed in and retrieved the tire. See there? Jem was scowling triumphantly. Nothin to it. I swear, Scout, sometimes you act so much like a girl its mortifyin. There was more to it than he knew, but I decided not to tell him. Calpurnia appeared in the front door and yelled, Lemonade time! You all get in outa that hot sun fore you fry alive! Lemonade in the middle of the morning was a summertime ritual. Calpurnia set a pitcher and three glasses on the porch, then went about her business. Being out of Jems good graces did not worry me especially. Lemonade would restore his good humor. Jem gulped down his second glassful and slapped his chest. I know what we are going to play, he announced. Something new, something different. What? asked Dill. Boo Radley. Jems head at times was transparent: he had thought that up to make me understand he wasnt afraid of Radleys in any shape or form, to contrast his own fearless heroism with my cowardice. Boo Radley? How? asked Dill. Jem said, Scout, you can be Mrs. Radley- I declare if I will. I dont think- Smatter? said Dill. Still scared? He can get out at night when were all asleep I said. Jem hissed. Scout, hows he gonna know what were doin? Besides, I dont think hes still there. He died years ago and they stuffed him up the chimney. Dill said, Jem, you and me can play and Scout can watch if shes scared. I was fairly sure Boo Radley was inside that house, but I couldnt prove it, and felt it best to keep my mouth shut or I would be accused of believing in Hot Steams, phenomena I was immune to in the daytime. Jem parceled out our roles: I was Mrs. Radley, and all I had to do was come out and sweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the sidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went under the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time. As the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, added dialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang changes every day. Dill was a villains villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and appear tall if height was part of the devilry required. He was as good as his worst performance; his worst performance was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted ladies who entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I played that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jems assurances that Boo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in the daytime and Atticus home at night. Jem was a born hero. It was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and neighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. Radley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her right forefinger (Dills contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldnt find any cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the time, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house. The three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a change; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with the brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff, assorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the Radleys than anybody in Maycomb. When it was time to play Boos big scene, Jem would sneak into the house, steal the scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when Calpurnias back was turned, then sit in the swing and cut up newspapers. Dill would walk by, cough at Jem, and Jem would fake a plunge into Dills thigh. From where I stood it looked real. When Mr. Nathan Radley passed us on his daily trip to town, we would stand still and silent until he was out of sight, then wonder what he would do to us if he suspected. Our activities halted when any of the neighbors appeared, and once I saw Miss Maudie Atkinson staring across the street at us, her hedge clippers poised in midair. One day we were so busily playing Chapter XXV, Book II of One Mans Family, we did not see Atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at us, slapping a rolled magazine against his knee. The sun said twelve noon. What are you all playing? he asked. Nothing, said Jem. Jems evasion told me our game was a secret, so I kept quiet. What are you doing with those scissors, then? Why are you tearing up that newspaper? If its todays Ill tan you. Nothing. Nothing what? said Atticus. Nothing, sir. Give me those scissors, Atticus said. Theyre no things to play with. Does this by any chance have anything to do with the Radleys? No sir, said Jem, reddening. I hope it doesnt, he said shortly, and went inside the hous
. Je-m Shut up! Hes gone in the livingroom, he can hear us in there. Safely in the yard, Dill asked Jem if we could play any more. I dont know. Atticus didnt say we couldnt- Jem, I said, I think Atticus knows it anyway. No he dont. If he did hed say he did. I was not so sure, but Jem told me I was being a girl, that girls always imagined things, thats why other people hated them so, and if I started behaving like one I could just go off and find some to play with. All right, you just keep it up then, I said. Youll find out. Atticuss arrival was the second reason I wanted to quit the game. The first reason happened the day I rolled into the Radley front yard. Through all the head-shaking, quelling of nausea and Jem-yelling, I had heard another sound, so low I could not have heard it from the sidewalk. Someone inside the house was laughing.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch4,"As the schoolyear inches along, Scout begins to realize that she's far more educated than her peers, and even more so, perhaps, than her teacher. As construction paper and crayon Projects evolve day after day, she realizes she is just plain bored. As she walks home from school there is a huge oak tree that sits on the corner of the Radley lot. She passes it every day without incident, only one day she spots two pieces of chewing gum in a knot in the tree. After making sure it won't kill her she hastily crams it into her mouth, and Jem is furious with her when he finds out, convinced that it's poisoned by Boo Radley. During their walk home on the last day of school Scout and Jem find another treasure in the tree, this time two old, shined up pennies. When Dill arrives for the summer two days later the group resumes their obsession with Boo Radley. They create a play that reenacts Boo's life, and continue with it all summer long until they are very nearly caught by Atticus."
"My nagging got the better of Jem eventually, as I knew it would, and to my relief we slowed down the game for a while. He still maintained, however, that Atticus hadnt said we couldnt, therefore we could; and if Atticus ever said we couldnt, Jem had thought of a way around it: he would simply change the names of the characters and then we couldnt be accused of playing anything. Dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action. Dill was becoming something of a trial anyway, following Jem about. He had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him, then he promptly forgot about it. He staked me out, marked as his property, said I was the only girl he would ever love, then he neglected me. I beat him up twice but it did no good, he only grew closer to Jem. They spent days together in the treehouse plotting and planning, calling me only when they needed a third party. But I kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a while, and on pain of being called a girl, I spent most of the remaining twilights that summer sitting with Miss Maudie Atkinson on her front porch. Jem and I had always enjoyed the free run of Miss Maudies yard if we kept out of her azaleas, but our contact with her was not clearly defined. Until Jem and Dill excluded me from their plans, she was only another lady in the neighborhood, but a relatively benign presence. Our tacit treaty with Miss Maudie was that we could play on her lawn, eat her scuppernongs if we didnt jump on the arbor, and explore her vast back lot, terms so generous we seldom spoke to her, so careful were we to preserve the delicate balance of our relationship, but Jem and Dill drove me closer to her with their behavior. Miss Maudie hated her house: time spent indoors was time wasted. She was a widow, a chameleon lady who worked in her flower beds in an old straw hat and mens coveralls, but after her five oclock bath she would appear on the porch and reign over the street in magisterial beauty. She loved everything that grew in Gods earth, even the weeds. With one exception. If she found a blade of nut grass in her yard it was like the Second Battle of the Marne: she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to blasts from beneath with a poisonous substance she said was so powerful itd kill us all if we didnt stand out of the way. Why cant you just pull it up? I asked, after witnessing a prolonged campaign against a blade not three inches high. Pull it up, child, pull it up? She picked up the limp sprout and squeezed her thumb up its tiny stalk. Microscopic grains oozed out. Why, one sprig of nut grass can ruin a whole yard. Look here. When it comes fall this dries up and the wind blows it all over Maycomb County! Miss Maudies face likened such an occurrence unto an Old Testament pestilence. Her speech was crisp for a Maycomb County inhabitant. She called us by all our names, and when she grinned she revealed two minute gold prongs clipped to her eyeteeth. When I admired them and hoped I would have some eventually, she said, Look here. With a click of her tongue she thrust out her bridgework, a gesture of cordiality that cemented our friendship. Miss Maudies benevolence extended to Jem and Dill, whenever they paused in their pursuits: we reaped the benefits of a talent Miss Maudie had hitherto kept hidden from us. She made the best cakes in the neighborhood. When she was admitted into our confidence, every time she baked she made a big cake and three little ones, and she would call across the street: Jem Finch, Scout Finch, Charles Baker Harris, come here! Our promptness was always rewarded. In summertime, twilights are long and peaceful. Often as not, Miss Maudie and I would sit silently on her porch, watching the sky go from yellow to pink as the sun went down, watching flights of martins sweep low over the neighborhood and disappear behind the schoolhouse rooftops. Miss Maudie, I said one evening, do you think Boo Radleys still alive? His names Arthur and hes alive, she said. She was rocking slowly in her big oak chair. Do you smell my mimosa? Its like angels breath this evening. Yessum. How do you know? Know what, child? That BMr. Arthurs still alive? What a morbid question. But I suppose its a morbid subject. I know hes alive, Jean Louise, because I havent seen him carried out yet. Maybe he died and they stuffed him up the chimney. Where did you get such a notion? Thats what Jem said he thought they did. S-ss-ss. He gets more like Jack Finch every day. Miss Maudie had known Uncle Jack Finch, Atticuss brother, since they were children. Nearly the same age, they had grown up together at Finchs Landing. Miss Maudie was the daughter of a neighboring landowner, Dr. Frank Buford. Dr. Bufords profession was medicine and his obsession was anything that grew in the ground, so he stayed poor. Uncle Jack Finch confined his passion for digging to his window boxes in Nashville and stayed rich. We saw Uncle Jack every Christmas, and every Christmas he yelled across the street for Miss Maudie to come marry him. Miss Maudie would yell back, Call a little louder, Jack Finch, and theyll hear you at the post office, I havent heard you yet! Jem and I thought this a strange way to ask for a ladys hand in marriage, but then Uncle Jack was rather strange. He said he was trying to get Miss Maudies goat, that he had been trying unsuccessfully for forty years, that he was the last person in the world Miss Maudie would think about marrying but the first person she thought about teasing, and the best defense to her was spirited offense, all of which we understood clearly. Arthur Radley just stays in the house, thats all, said Miss Maudie. Wouldnt you stay in the house if you didnt want to come out? Yessum, but Id wanta come out. Why doesnt he? Miss Maudies eyes narrowed. You know that story as well as I do. I never heard why, though. Nobody ever told me why. Miss Maudie settled her bridgework. You know old Mr. Radley was a foot-washing Baptist- Thats what you are, aint it? My shells not that hard, child. Im just a Baptist. Dont you all believe in foot-washing? We do. At home in the bathtub. But we cant have communion with you all- Apparently deciding that it was easier to define primitive baptistry than closed communion, Miss Maudie said: Foot-washers believe anything thats pleasure is a sin. Did you know some of em came out of the woods one Saturday and passed by this place and told me me and my flowers were going to hell? Your flowers, too? Yes maam. Theyd burn right with me. They thought I spent too much time in Gods outdoors and not enough time inside the house reading the Bible. My confidence in pulpit Gospel lessened at the vision of Miss Maudie stewing forever in various Protestant hells. True enough, she had an acid tongue in her head, and she did not go about the neighborhood doing good, as did Miss Stephanie Crawford. But while no one with a grain of sense trusted Miss Stephanie, Jem and I had considerable faith in Miss Maudie. She had never told on us, had never played cat-and-mouse with us, she was not at all interested in our private lives. She was our friend. How so reasonable a creature could live in peril of everlasting torment was incomprehensible. That aint right, Miss Maudie. Youre the best lady I know. Miss Maudie grinned. Thank you maam. Thing is, foot-washers think women are a sin by definition. They take the Bible literally, you know. Is that why Mr. Arthur stays in the house, to keep away from women? Ive no idea. It doesnt make sense to me. Looks like if Mr. Arthur was hankerin after heaven hed come out on the porch at least. Atticus says Gods loving folks like you love yourself- Miss Maudie stopped rocking, and her voice hardened. You are too young to understand it, she said, but sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand ofoh, of your father. I was shocked. Atticus doesnt drink whiskey, I said. He never drunk a drop in his lifenome, yes he did. He said he drank some one time and didnt like it. Miss Maudie laughed. Wasnt talking about your father, she said. What I meant was, if Atticus Finch drank until he was drunk he wouldnt be as hard as some men are at their best. There are just some kind of men whowhore so busy worrying about the next world theyve never learned to live in this one, and you can look down the street and see theresults. Do you think theyre true, all those things they say about BMr. Arthur? What things? I told her. That is three-fourths colored folks and one-fourth Stephanie Crawford, said Miss Maudie grimly. Stephanie Crawford even told me once she woke up in the middle of the night and found him looking in the window at her. I said what did you do, Stephanie, move over in the bed and make room for him? That shut her up awhile. I was sure it did. Miss Maudies voice was enough to shut anybodyup. No, child, she said, that is a sad house. I remember Arthur Radley when he was a boy. He always spoke nicely to me, no matter what folks said he did. Spoke as nicely as he knew how. You reckon hes crazy? Miss Maudie shook her head. If hes not he should be by now. The things that happen to people we never really know. What happens in houses behind closed doors, what secrets- Atticus dont ever do anything to Jem and me in the house that he dont do in the yard, I said, feeling it my duty to defend my parent. Gracious child, I was raveling a thread, wasnt even thinking about your father, but now that I am Ill say this: Atticus Finch is the same in his house as he is on the public streets. Howd you like some fresh poundcake to take home? I liked it very much.  Next morning when I awakened I found Jem and Dill in the back yard deep in conversation. When I joined them, as usual they said go away. Will not. This yards as much mine as it is yours, Jem Finch. I got just as much right to play in it as you have. Dill and Jem emerged from a brief huddle: If you stay youve got to do what we tell you, Dill warned. We-ll, I said, whos so high and mighty all of a sudden? If you dont say youll do what we tell you, we aint gonna tell you anything, Dill continued. You act like you grew ten inches in the night! All right, what is it? Jem said placidly, We are going to give a note to Boo Radley. Just how? I was trying to fight down the automatic terror rising in me. It was all right for Miss Maudie to talkshe was old and snug on her porch. It was different for us. Jem was merely going to put the note on the end of a fishing pole and stick it through the shutters. If anyone came along, Dill would ring the bell. Dill raised his right hand. In it was my mothers silver dinner-bell. Im goin around to the side of the house, said Jem. We looked yesterday from across the street, and theres a shutter loose. Think maybe I can make it stick on the window sill, at least. Jem- Now youre in it and you cant get out of it, youll just stay in it, Miss Priss! Okay, okay, but I dont wanta watch. Jem, somebody was- Yes you will, youll watch the back end of the lot and Dills gonna watch the front of the house an up the street, an if anybody comes hell ring the bell. That clear? All right then. Whatd you write him? Dill said, Were askin him real politely to come out sometimes, and tell us what he does in therewe said we wouldnt hurt him and wed buy him an ice cream. You allve gone crazy, hell kill us! Dill said, Its my idea. I figure if hed come out and sit a spell with us he might feel better. How do you know he dont feel good? Well howd you feel if youd been shut up for a hundred years with nothin but cats to eat? I bet hes got a beard down to here- Like your daddys? He aint got a beard, he- Dill stopped, as if trying to remember. Uh huh, caughtcha, I said. You said fore you were off the train good your daddy had a black beard- If its all the same to you he shaved it off last summer! Yeah, an Ive got the letter to prove ithe sent me two dollars, too! Keep onI reckon he even sent you a mounted police uniform! Thatn never showed up, did it? You just keep on tellin em, son- Dill Harris could tell the biggest ones I ever heard. Among other things, he had been up in a mail plane seventeen times, he had been to Nova Scotia, he had seen an elephant, and his granddaddy was Brigadier General Joe Wheeler and left him his sword. You all hush, said Jem. He scuttled beneath the house and came out with a yellow bamboo pole. Reckon this is long enough to reach from the sidewalk? Anybody whos brave enough to go up and touch the house hadnt oughta use a fishin pole, I said. Why dont you just knock the front door down? Thisisdifferent, said Jem, how many times do I have to tell you that? Dill took a piece of paper from his pocket and gave it to Jem. The three of us walked cautiously toward the old house. Dill remained at the light-pole on the front corner of the lot, and Jem and I edged down the sidewalk parallel to the side of the house. I walked beyond Jem and stood where I could see around the curve. All clear, I said. Not a soul in sight. Jem looked up the sidewalk to Dill, who nodded. Jem attached the note to the end of the fishing pole, let the pole out across the yard and pushed it toward the window he had selected. The pole lacked several inches of being long enough, and Jem leaned over as far as he could. I watched him making jabbing motions for so long, I abandoned my post and went to him. Cant get it off the pole, he muttered, or if I got it off I cant make it stay. Gon back down the street, Scout. I returned and gazed around the curve at the empty road. Occasionally I looked back at Jem, who was patiently trying to place the note on the window sill. It would flutter to the ground and Jem would jab it up, until I thought if Boo Radley ever received it he wouldnt be able to read it. I was looking down the street when the dinner-bell rang. Shoulder up, I reeled around to face Boo Radley and his bloody fangs; instead, I saw Dill ringing the bell with all his might in Atticuss face. Jem looked so awful I didnt have the heart to tell him I told him so. He trudged along, dragging the pole behind him on the sidewalk. Atticus said, Stop ringing that bell. Dill grabbed the clapper; in the silence that followed, I wished hed start ringing it again. Atticus pushed his hat to the back of his head and put his hands on his hips. Jem, he said, what were you doing? Nothin, sir. I dont want any of that. Tell me. I waswe were just tryin to give somethin to Mr. Radley. What were you trying to give him? Just a letter. Let me see it. Jem held out a filthy piece of paper. Atticus took it and tried to read it. Why do you want Mr. Radley to come out? Dill said, We thought he might enjoy us and dried up when Atticus looked at him. Son, he said to Jem, Im going to tell you something and tell you one time: stop tormenting that man. That goes for the other two of you. What Mr. Radley did was his own business. If he wanted to come out, he would. If he wanted to stay inside his own house he had the right to stay inside free from the attentions of inquisitive children, which was a mild term for the likes of us. How would we like it if Atticus barged in on us without knocking, when we were in our rooms at night? We were, in effect, doing the same thing to Mr. Radley. What Mr. Radley did might seem peculiar to us, but it did not seem peculiar to him. Furthermore, had it never occurred to us that the civil way to communicate with another being was by the front door instead of a side window? Lastly, we were to stay away from that house until we were invited there, we were not to play an asinine game he had seen us playing or make fun of anybody on this street or in this town- We werent makin fun of him, we werent laughin at him, said Jem, we were just- So that was what you were doing, wasnt it? Makin fun of him? No, said Atticus, putting his lifes history on display for the edification of the neighborhood. Jem seemed to swell a little. I didnt say we were doin that, I d
dnt say it! Atticus grinned dryly. You just told me, he said. You stop this nonsense right now, every one of you. Jem gaped at him. You want to be a lawyer, dont you? Our fathers mouth was suspiciously firm, as if he were trying to hold it in line. Jem decided there was no point in quibbling, and was silent. When Atticus went inside the house to retrieve a file he had forgotten to take to work that morning, Jem finally realized that he had been done in by the oldest lawyers trick on record. He waited a respectful distance from the front steps, watched Atticus leave the house and walk toward town. When Atticus was out of earshot Jem yelled after him: I thought I wanted to be a lawyer but I aint so sure now!",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch5,"When Dill and Jem start excluding Scout from their plots she begins to spend more time with her next door neighbor, Miss Maudie Atkinson. Miss Maudie is garden obsessed, and spends her evenings reining over her front porch in the twilight. Scout gets a lot of valuable information from her about Boo Radley's past, and the reason, perhaps, why he never comes out. The next day she uncovers a major plot by Dill and Jem to pass a note to Boo Radley. Scout protests but they threaten her and before she knows it she's part of the scheme. Things proceed fairly smoothly until they're caught by Atticus, who forbids them to set one more foot on the Radley property and to leave Mr. Radley alone."
"Yes, said our father, when Jem asked him if we could go over and sit by Miss Rachels fishpool with Dill, as this was his last night in Maycomb. Tell him so long for me, and well see him next summer. We leaped over the low wall that separated Miss Rachels yard from our driveway. Jem whistled bob-white and Dill answered in the darkness. Not a breath blowing, said Jem. Looka yonder. He pointed to the east. A gigantic moon was rising behind Miss Maudies pecan trees. That makes it seem hotter, he said. Cross in it tonight? asked Dill, not looking up. He was constructing a cigarette from newspaper and string. No, just the lady. Dont light that thing, Dill, youll stink up this whole end of town. There was a lady in the moon in Maycomb. She sat at a dresser combing her hair. Were gonna miss you, boy, I said. Reckon we better watch for Mr. Avery? Mr. Avery boarded across the street from Mrs. Henry Lafayette Duboses house. Besides making change in the collection plate every Sunday, Mr. Avery sat on the porch every night until nine oclock and sneezed. One evening we were privileged to witness a performance by him which seemed to have been his positively last, for he never did it again so long as we watched. Jem and I were leaving Miss Rachels front steps one night when Dill stopped us: Golly, looka yonder. He pointed across the street. At first we saw nothing but a kudzu-covered front porch, but a closer inspection revealed an arc of water descending from the leaves and splashing in the yellow circle of the street light, some ten feet from source to earth, it seemed to us. Jem said Mr. Avery misfigured, Dill said he must drink a gallon a day, and the ensuing contest to determine relative distances and respective prowess only made me feel left out again, as I was untalented in this area. Dill stretched, yawned, and said altogether too casually. I know what, lets go for a walk. He sounded fishy to me. Nobody in Maycomb just went for a walk. Where to, Dill? Dill jerked his head in a southerly direction. Jem said, Okay. When I protested, he said sweetly, You dont have to come along, Angel May. You dont have to go. Remember- Jem was not one to dwell on past defeats: it seemed the only message he got from Atticus was insight into the art of cross examination. Scout, we aint gonna do anything, were just goin to the street light and back. We strolled silently down the sidewalk, listening to porch swings creaking with the weight of the neighborhood, listening to the soft night-murmurs of the grown people on our street. Occasionally we heard Miss Stephanie Crawford laugh. Well? said Dill. Okay, said Jem. Why dont you go on home, Scout? What are you gonna do? Dill and Jem were simply going to peep in the window with the loose shutter to see if they could get a look at Boo Radley, and if I didnt want to go with them I could go straight home and keep my fat flopping mouth shut, that was all. But what in the sam holy hill did you wait till tonight? Because nobody could see them at night, because Atticus would be so deep in a book he wouldnt hear the Kingdom coming, because if Boo Radley killed them theyd miss school instead of vacation, and because it was easier to see inside a dark house in the dark than in the daytime, did I understand? Jem,please Scout, Im tellin you for the last time, shut your trap or go homeI declare to the Lord youre gettin more like a girl every day! With that, I had no option but to join them. We thought it was better to go under the high wire fence at the rear of the Radley lot, we stood less chance of being seen. The fence enclosed a large garden and a narrow woodenouthouse. Jem held up the bottom wire and motioned Dill under it. I followed, and held up the wire for Jem. It was a tight squeeze for him. Dont make a sound, he whispered. Dont get in a row of collards whatever you do, theyll wake thedead. With this thought in mind, I made perhaps one step per minute. I moved faster when I saw Jem far ahead beckoning in the moonlight. We came to the gate that divided the garden from the back yard. Jem touched it. The gatesqueaked. Spit on it, whispered Dill. Youve got us in a box, Jem, I muttered. We cant get out of here so easy. Sh-h. Spit on it, Scout. We spat ourselves dry, and Jem opened the gate slowly, lifting it aside and resting it on the fence. We were in the back yard. The back of the Radley house was less inviting than the front: a ramshackle porch ran the width of the house; there were two doors and two dark windows between the doors. Instead of a column, a rough two-by-four supported one end of the roof. An old Franklin stove sat in a corner of the porch; above it a hat-rack mirror caught the moon and shone eerily. Ar-r, said Jem softly, lifting his foot. Smatter? Chickens, he breathed. That we would be obliged to dodge the unseen from all directions was confirmed when Dill ahead of us spelled G-o-d in a whisper. We crept to the side of the house, around to the window with the hanging shutter. The sill was several inches taller than Jem. Give you a hand up, he muttered to Dill. Wait, though. Jem grabbed his left wrist and my right wrist, I grabbed my left wrist and Jems right wrist, we crouched, and Dill sat on our saddle. We raised him and he caught the window sill. Hurry, Jem whispered, we cant last much longer. Dill punched my shoulder, and we lowered him to the ground. Whatd you see? Nothing. Curtains. Theres a little teeny light way off somewhere, though. Lets get away from here, breathed Jem. Lets go round in back again. Sh-h, he warned me, as I was about to protest. Lets try the back window. Dill,no, I said. Dill stopped and let Jem go ahead. When Jem put his foot on the bottom step, the step squeaked. He stood still, then tried his weight by degrees. The step was silent. Jem skipped two steps, put his foot on the porch, heaved himself to it, and teetered a long moment. He regained his balance and dropped to his knees. He crawled to the window, raised his head and lookedin. Then I saw the shadow. It was the shadow of a man with a hat on. At first I thought it was a tree, but there was no wind blowing, and tree-trunks never walked. The back porch was bathed in moonlight, and the shadow, crisp as toast, moved across the porch toward Jem. Dill saw it next. He put his hands to his face. When it crossed Jem, Jem saw it. He put his arms over his head and went rigid. The shadow stopped about a foot beyond Jem. Its arm came out from its side, dropped, and was still. Then it turned and moved back across Jem, walked along the porch and off the side of the house, returning as it had come. Jem leaped off the porch and galloped toward us. He flung open the gate, danced Dill and me through, and shooed us between two rows of swishing collards. Halfway through the collards I tripped; as I tripped the roar of a shotgun shattered the neighborhood. Dill and Jem dived beside me. Jems breath came in sobs: Fence by the schoolyard!hurry, Scout! Jem held the bottom wire; Dill and I rolled through and were halfway to the shelter of the schoolyards solitary oak when we sensed that Jem was not with us. We ran back and found him struggling in the fence, kicking his pants off to get loose. He ran to the oak tree in his shorts. Safely behind it, we gave way to numbness, but Jems mind was racing: We gotta get home, theyll miss us. We ran across the schoolyard, crawled under the fence to Deers Pasture behind our house, climbed our back fence and were at the back steps before Jem would let us pause to rest. Respiration normal, the three of us strolled as casually as we could to the front yard. We looked down the street and saw a circle of neighbors at the Radley front gate. We better go down there, said Jem. Theyll think its funny if we dont show up. Mr. Nathan Radley was standing inside his gate, a shotgun broken across his arm. Atticus was standing beside Miss Maudie and Miss Stephanie Crawford. Miss Rachel and Mr. Avery were near by. None of them saw us come up. We eased in beside Miss Maudie, who looked around. Where were you all, didnt you hear the commotion? What happened? asked Jem. Mr. Radley shot at a Negro in his collard patch. Oh. Did he hit him? No, said Miss Stephanie. Shot in the air. Scared him pale, though. Says if anybody sees a white nigger around, thats the one. Says hes got the other barrel waitin for the next sound he hears in that patch, an next time he wont aim high, be it dog, nigger, orJemFinch! Maam? asked Jem. Atticus spoke. Wherere your pants, son? Pants, sir? Pants. It was no use. In his shorts before God and everybody. I sighed. AhMr. Finch? In the glare from the streetlight, I could see Dill hatching one: his eyes widened, his fat cherub face grew rounder. What is it, Dill? asked Atticus. AhI won em from him, he said vaguely. Won them? How? Dills hand sought the back of his head. He brought it forward and across his forehead. We were playin strip poker up yonder by the fishpool, he said. Jem and I relaxed. The neighbors seemed satisfied: they all stiffened. But what was strip poker? We had no chance to find out: Miss Rachel went off like the town fire siren: Do-o-o Jee-sus, Dill Harris! Gamblin by my fishpool? Ill strip-poker you, sir! Atticus saved Dill from immediate dismemberment. Just a minute, Miss Rachel, he said. Ive never heard of em doing that before. Were you all playing cards? Jem fielded Dills fly with his eyes shut: No sir, just with matches. I admired my brother. Matches were dangerous, but cards were fatal. Jem, Scout, said Atticus, I dont want to hear of poker in any form again. Go by Dills and get your pants, Jem. Settle it yourselves. Dont worry, Dill, said Jem, as we trotted up the sidewalk, she aint gonna get you. Hell talk her out of it. That was fast thinkin, son. Listen you hear? We stopped, and heard Atticuss voice:not serious they all go through it, Miss Rachel Dill was comforted, but Jem and I werent. There was the problem of Jem showing up some pants in the morning. d give you some of mine, said Dill, as we came to Miss Rachels steps. Jem said he couldnt get in them, but thanks anyway. We said good-bye, and Dill went inside the house. He evidently remembered he was engaged to me, for he ran back out and kissed me swiftly in front of Jem. Yawl write, hear? he bawled after us.  Had Jems pants been safely on him, we would not have slept much anyway. Every night-sound I heard from my cot on the back porch was magnified three-fold; every scratch of feet on gravel was Boo Radley seeking revenge, every passing Negro laughing in the night was Boo Radley loose and after us; insects splashing against the screen were Boo Radleys insane fingers picking the wire to pieces; the chinaberry trees were malignant, hovering, alive. I lingered between sleep and wakefulness until I heard Jem murmur. Sleep, Little Three-Eyes? Are you crazy? Sh-h. Atticuss lights out. In the waning moonlight I saw Jem swing his feet to the floor. Im goin after em, he said. I sat upright. You cant. I wont let you. He was struggling into his shirt. Ive got to. You do an Ill wake up Atticus. You do and Ill kill you. I pulled him down beside me on the cot. I tried to reason with him. Mr. Nathans gonna find em in the morning, Jem. He knows you lost em. When he shows em to Atticus itll be pretty bad, thats all there is to it. Gon back tobed. Thats what I know, said Jem. Thats why Im goin afterem. I began to feel sick. Going back to that place by himselfI remembered Miss Stephanie: Mr. Nathan had the other barrel waiting for the next sound he heard, be it nigger, dog Jem knew that better than I. I was desperate: Look, it aint worth it, Jem. A lickin hurts but it doesnt last. Youll get your head shot off, Jem. Please He blew out his breath patiently. Iits like this, Scout, he muttered. Atticus aint ever whipped me since I can remember. I wanta keep it that way. This was a thought. It seemed that Atticus threatened us every other day. You mean hes never caught you at anything. Maybe so, butI just wanta keep it that way, Scout. We shouldna done that tonight, Scout. It was then, I suppose, that Jem and I first began to part company. Sometimes I did not understand him, but my periods of bewilderment were short-lived. This was beyond me. Please, I pleaded, cantcha just think about it for a minuteby yourself on that place Shut up! Its not like hed never speak to you again or somethin Im gonna wake him up, Jem, I swear I am Jem grabbed my pajama collar and wrenched it tight. Then Im goin with you I choked. No you aint, youll just make noise. It was no use. I unlatched the back door and held it while he crept down the steps. It must have been two oclock. The moon was setting and the lattice-work shadows were fading into fuzzy nothingness. Jems white shirt-tail dipped and bobbed like a small ghost dancing away to escape the coming morning. A faint breeze stirred and cooled the sweat running down my sides. He went the back way, through Deers Pasture, across the schoolyard and around to the fence, I thoughtat least that was the way he was headed. It would take longer, so it was not time to worry yet. I waited until it was time to worry and listened for Mr. Radleys shotgun. Then I thought I heard the back fence squeak. It was wishful thinking. Then I heard Atticus cough. I held my breath. Sometimes when we made a midnight pilgrimage to the bathroom we would find him reading. He said he often woke up during the night, checked on us, and read himself back to sleep. I waited for his light to go on, straining my eyes to see it flood the hall. It stayed off, and I breathed again. The night- crawlers had retired, but ripe chinaberries drummed on the roof when the wind stirred, and the darkness was desolate with the barking of distant dogs. There he was, returning to me. His white shirt bobbed over the back fence and slowly grew larger. He came up the back steps, latched the door behind him, and sat on his cot. Wordlessly, he held up his pants. He lay down, and for a while I heard his cot trembling. Soon he was still. I did not hear him stir again.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch6,"The last night of the summer Jem and Dill hatch the biggest plot of them all (reasoning that, if they get killed, they'll miss school instead of vacation). They decide to try and peep into one of the windows at the Radley house. When Scout (who until tonight knew nothing of the plan) starts to protest, they call her a girl and threaten to send her home. With that, she joins them. Things take a disastrous turn when Boo Radley's older brother, Mr. Nathan Radley, hears them and, thinking they're intruders, fires a shotgun. They barely make it through the fence in time and high tail it back home so they're not missed by the adults. When they step into the gathering crowd to discuss the gunshot Scout is horrified to realize that Jem is missing his pants. Dill hatches a good one and tells Atticus that he won them from Jem playing strip poker. The adults seem satisfied with the lie, and don't suspect them of causing the gunfire at the Radley place. After they slink off, Scout discovers from Jem that he lost his pants as they were scurrying through the wire fence. They got caught and he had to leave them behind or risk getting shot. Late that night Jem decides to go after them rather than risk Mr. Nathan finding them the next morning and turning him in. Scout pleads with him not to go, but he does it anyway. When he gets back, he doesn't say a word but lies in bed, trembling."
"Jem stayed moody and silent for a week. As Atticus had once advised me to do, I tried to climb into Jems skin and walk around in it: if I had gone alone to the Radley Place at two in the morning, my funeral would have been held the next afternoon. So I left Jem alone and tried not to bother him. School started. The second grade was as bad as the first, only worsethey still flashed cards at you and wouldnt let you read or write. Miss Carolines progress next door could be estimated by the frequency of laughter; however, the usual crew had flunked the first grade again, and were helpful in keeping order. The only thing good about the second grade was that this year I had to stay as late as Jem, and we usually walked home together at three oclock. One afternoon when we were crossing the schoolyard toward home, Jem suddenly said: Theres something I didnt tell you. As this was his first complete sentence in several days, I encouraged him: About what? About that night. Youve never told me anything about that night, I said. Jem waved my words away as if fanning gnats. He was silent for a while, then he said, When I went back for my breechesthey were all in a tangle when I was gettin out of em, I couldnt get em loose. When I went back Jem took a deep breath. When I went back, they were folded across the fence like they were expectin me. Across And something else Jems voice was flat. Show you when we get home. Theyd been sewed up. Not like a lady sewed em, like somethin Id try to do. All crooked. Its almost like somebody knew you were comin back for em. Jem shuddered. Like somebody was readin my mind like somebody could tell what I was gonna do. Cant anybody tell what Im gonna do lest they know me, can they, Scout? Jems question was an appeal. I reassured him: Cant anybody tell what youre gonna do lest they live in the house with you, and even I cant tell sometimes. We were walking past our tree. In its knot-hole rested a ball of gray twine. Dont take it, Jem, I said. This is somebodys hidin place. I dont think so, Scout. Yes it is. Somebody like Walter Cunningham comes down here every recess and hides his thingsand we come along and take em away from him. Listen, lets leave it and wait a couple of days. If it aint gone then, well take it, okay? Okay, you might be right, said Jem. It must be some little kids placehides his things from the bigger folks. You know its only when schools in that weve found things. Yeah, I said, but we never go by here in the summertime. We went home. Next morning the twine was where we had left it. When it was still there on the third day, Jem pocketed it. From then on, we considered everything we found in the knot-hole our property.  The second grade was grim, but Jem assured me that the older I got the better school would be, that he started off the same way, and it was not until one reached the sixth grade that one learned anything of value. The sixth grade seemed to please him from the beginning: he went through a brief Egyptian Period that baffled mehe tried to walk flat a great deal, sticking one arm in front of him and one in back of him, putting one foot behind the other. He declared Egyptians walked that way; I said if they did I didnt see how they got anything done, but Jem said they accomplished more than the Americans ever did, they invented toilet paper and perpetual embalming, and asked where would we be today if they hadnt? Atticus told me to delete the adjectives and Id have the facts. There are no clearly defined seasons in South Alabama; summer drifts into autumn, and autumn is sometimes never followed by winter, but turns to a days-old spring that melts into summer again. That fall was a long one, hardly cool enough for a light jacket. Jem and I were trotting in our orbit one mild October afternoon when our knot-hole stopped us again. Something white was inside this time. Jem let me do the honors: I pulled out two small images carved in soap. One was the figure of a boy, the other wore a crude dress. Before I remembered that there was no such thing as hoo-dooing, I shrieked and threw them down. Jemsnatchedthemup.Whatsthematterwithyou?heyelled.Herubbedthefigures free of red dust. These are good, he said. Ive never seen any thesegood. He held them down to me. They were almost perfect miniatures of two children. The boy had on shorts, and a shock of soapy hair fell to his eyebrows. I looked up at Jem. A point of straight brown hair kicked downwards from his part. I had never noticed it before. Jem looked from the girl-doll to me. The girl-doll wore bangs. So didI. These are us, he said. Who did em, you reckon? Who do we know around here who whittles? he asked. Mr. Avery. Mr. Avery just does like this. I mean carves. Mr. Avery averaged a stick of stovewood per week; he honed it down to a toothpick and chewed it. Theres old Miss Stephanie Crawfords sweetheart, I said. He carves all right, but he lives down the country. When would he ever pay any attention to us? Maybe he sits on the porch and looks at us instead of Miss Stephanie. If I was him, I would. Jem stared at me so long I asked what was the matter, but got Nothing, Scout for an answer. When we went home, Jem put the dolls in his trunk. Less than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum, which we enjoyed, the fact that everything on the Radley Place was poison having slipped Jems memory. The following week the knot-hole yielded a tarnished medal. Jem showed it to Atticus, who said it was a spelling medal, that before we were born the Maycomb County schools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners. Atticus said someone must have lost it, and had we asked around? Jem camel-kicked me when I tried to say where we had found it. Jem asked Atticus if he remembered anybody who ever won one, and Atticus said no. Our biggest prize appeared four days later. It was a pocket watch that wouldnt run, on a chain with an aluminum knife. You reckon its white gold, Jem? Dont know. Ill show it to Atticus. Atticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars, knife, chain and all, if it were new. Did you swap with somebody at school? he asked. Oh, no sir! Jem pulled out his grandfathers watch that Atticus let him carry once a week if Jem were careful with it. On the days he carried the watch, Jem walked on eggs. Atticus, if its all right with you, Id rather have this one instead. Maybe I can fix it. When the new wore off his grandfathers watch, and carrying it became a days burdensome task, Jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every five minutes. He did a fair job, only one spring and two tiny pieces left over, but the watch would not run. Oh-h, he sighed, itll never go. Scout? Huh? You reckon we oughta write a letter to whoevers leaving us these things? Thatd be right nice, Jem, we can thank emwhats wrong? Jem was holding his ears, shaking his head from side to side. I dont get it, I just dont get itI dont know why, Scout He looked toward the livingroom. Ive gotta good mind to tell Atticusno, I reckon not. Ill tell him for you. No, dont do that, Scout. Scout? Wha-t? He had been on the verge of telling me something all evening; his face would brighten and he would lean toward me, then he would change his mind. He changed it again. Oh, nothin. Here, lets write a letter. I pushed a tablet and pencil under his nose. Okay. Dear Mister How do you know its a man? I bet its Miss Maudiebeen bettin that for a long time. Ar-r, Miss Maudie cant chew gum Jem broke into a grin. You know, she can talk real pretty sometimes. One time I asked her to have a chew and she said no thanks, thatchewing gum cleaved to her palate and rendered her speechless, said Jem carefully. Doesnt that sound nice? Yeah, she can say nice things sometimes. She wouldnt have a watch and chain anyway. Dear sir, said Jem. We appreciate theno, we appreciate everything which you have put into the tree for us. Yours very truly, Jeremy Atticus Finch. He wont know who you are if you sign it like that, Jem. Jem erased his name and wrote, Jem Finch. I signed, Jean Louise Finch (Scout), beneath it. Jem put the note in an envelope. Next morning on the way to school he ran ahead of me and stopped at the tree. Jem was facing me when he looked up, and I saw him go stark white. Scout! I ran to him. Someone had filled our knot-hole with cement. Dont you cry, now, Scout dont cry now, dont you worry- he muttered at me all the way to school. When we went home for dinner Jem bolted his food, ran to the porch and stood on the steps. I followed him. Hasnt passed by yet, he said. Next day Jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded. Hidy do, Mr. Nathan, he said. Morning Jem, Scout, said Mr. Radley, as he went by. Mr. Radley, said Jem. Mr. Radley turned around. Mr. Radley, ahdid you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder? Yes, he said. I filled it up. Whyd you do it, sir? Trees dying. You plug em with cement when theyre sick. You ought to know that, Jem. Jem said nothing more about it until late afternoon. When we passed our tree he gave it a meditative pat on its cement, and remained deep in thought. He seemed to be working himself into a bad humor, so I kept my distance. As usual, we met Atticus coming home from work that evening. When we were at our steps Jem said, Atticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir. What tree, son? The one on the corner of the Radley lot comin from school. Yes? Is that tree dyin? Why no, son, I dont think so. Look at the leaves, theyre all green and full, no brown patches anywhere It aint even sick? That trees as healthy as you are, Jem. Why? Mr. Nathan Radley said it was dyin. Well maybe it is. Im sure Mr. Radley knows more about his trees than we do. Atticus left us on the porch. Jem leaned on a pillar, rubbing his shoulders against it. Do you itch, Jem? I asked as politely as I could. He did not answer. Come on in, Jem, I said. Afterwhile. He stood there until nightfall, and I waited for him. When we went in the house I saw he had been crying; his face was dirty in the right places, but I thought it odd that I had not heardhim.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch7,"Jem's silence about that night lasts for a week. They both start school again, and Scout discovers that the second grade is worse than the first, and the only consolation is that now she gets to stay as late as Jem and they can walk home together. It's during this walk home one afternoon that Jem finally opens up about his sojourn trip back to the Radley place to retrieve his pants. He tells Scout that his pants were not tangled up the wire as he left them but were folded neatly on the fence post, as if someone was expecting him to come back and get them. As they approach the oak tree with the knot hole they discover a ball of twine. After waiting a few days to make sure that the knot hole is not some other child's hiding place, they take ownership of everything they find in there from here on out. The next treasure they discover in there is the figure of a boy and girl carved out of soap. They're carved to look like Scout and Jem. The next prize is an old pocket watch that doesn't run. They decide to write a letter to whomever is leaving them things, but they're shocked to discover the next day that the hole has been filled with cement. When they question Mr. Nathan Radley (Boo's brother who does leave the house) he tells them the tree was sick and he had to do it. Upon questioning Atticus, however, he tells them that tree is perfectly healthy."
"For reasons unfathomable to the most experienced prophets in Maycomb County, autumn turned to winter that year. We had two weeks of the coldest weather since 1885, Atticus said. Mr. Avery said it was written on the Rosetta Stone that when children disobeyed their parents, smoked cigarettes and made war on each other, the seasons would change: Jem and I were burdened with the guilt of contributing to the aberrations of nature, thereby causing unhappiness to our neighbors and discomfort to ourselves. Old Mrs. Radley died that winter, but her death caused hardly a ripplethe neighborhood seldom saw her, except when she watered her cannas. Jem and I decided that Boo had got her at last, but when Atticus returned from the Radley house he said she died of natural causes, to our disappointment. Ask him, Jem whispered. You ask him, youre the oldest. Thats why you oughta ask him. Atticus, I said, did you see Mr. Arthur? Atticus looked sternly around his newspaper at me: I did not. Jem restrained me from further questions. He said Atticus was still touchous about us and the Radleys and it wouldnt do to push him any. Jem had a notion that Atticus thought our activities that night last summer were not solely confined to strip poker. Jem had no firm basis for his ideas, he said it was merely a twitch. Next morning I awoke, looked out the window and nearly died of fright. My screams brought Atticus from his bathroom half-shaven. Theworldsendin, Atticus! Please do something! I dragged him to the window and pointed. No its not, he said. Its snowing. Jem asked Atticus would it keep up. Jem had never seen snow either, but he knew what it was. Atticus said he didnt know any more about snow than Jem did. I think, though, if its watery like that, itll turn to rain. The telephone rang and Atticus left the breakfast table to answer it. That was Eula May, he said when he returned. I quoteAs it has not snowed in Maycomb County since 1885, there will be no schooltoday. Eula May was Maycombs leading telephone operator. She was entrusted with issuing public announcements, wedding invitations, setting off the fire siren, and giving first-aid instructions when Dr. Reynolds wasaway. When Atticus finally called us to order and bade us look at our plates instead of out the windows, Jem asked, How do you make a snowman? I havent the slightest idea, said Atticus. I dont want you all to be disappointed, but I doubt if therell be enough snow for a snowball, even. Calpurnia came in and said she thought it was sticking. When we ran to the back yard, it was covered with a feeble layer of soggy snow. We shouldnt walk about in it, said Jem. Look, every step you takes wasting it. I looked back at my mushy footprints. Jem said if we waited until it snowed some more we could scrape it all up for a snowman. I stuck out my tongue and caught a fat flake. It burned. Jem, its hot! No it aint, its so cold it burns. Now dont eat it, Scout, youre wasting it. Let it come down. But I want to walk in it. I know what, we can go walk over at Miss Maudies. Jem hopped across the front yard. I followed in his tracks. When we were on the sidewalk in front of Miss Maudies, Mr. Avery accosted us. He had a pink face and a big stomach below his belt. See what youve done? he said. Hasnt snowed in Maycomb since Appomattox. Its bad children like you makes the seasons change. I wondered if Mr. Avery knew how hopefully we had watched last summer for him to repeat his performance, and reflected that if this was our reward, there was something to say for sin. I did not wonder where Mr. Avery gathered his meteorological statistics: they came straight from the Rosetta Stone. Jem Finch, you Jem Finch! Miss Maudies callin you, Jem. You all stay in the middle of the yard. Theres some thrift buried under the snow near the porch. Dont step on it! Yessum! called Jem. Its beautiful, aint it, Miss Maudie? Beautiful my hind foot! If it freezes tonight itll carry off all my azaleas! Miss Maudies old sunhat glistened with snow crystals. She was bending over some small bushes, wrapping them in burlap bags. Jem asked her what she was doing that for. Keep em warm, she said. How can flowers keep warm? They dont circulate. I cannot answer that question, Jem Finch. All I know is if it freezes tonight these plantsll freeze, so you cover em up. Is that clear? Yessum. Miss Maudie? What, sir? Could Scout and me borrow some of your snow? Heavens alive, take it all! Theres an old peach basket under the house, haul it off in that. Miss Maudies eyes narrowed. Jem Finch, what are you going to do with my snow? Youll see, said Jem, and we transferred as much snow as we could from Miss Maudies yard to ours, a slushyoperation. What are we gonna do, Jem? Iasked. Youll see, he said. Now get the basket and haul all the snow you can rake up from the back yard to the front. Walk back in your tracks, though, he cautioned. Are we gonna have a snow baby, Jem? No, a real snowman. Gotta work hard, now. Jem ran to the back yard, produced the garden hoe and began digging quickly behind the woodpile, placing any worms he found to one side. He went in the house, returned with the laundry hamper, filled it with earth and carried it to the front yard. When we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow, Jem said we were ready to begin. Dont you think this is kind of a mess? I asked. Looks messy now, but it wont later, he said. Jem scooped up an armful of dirt, patted it into a mound on which he added another load, and another until he had constructed a torso. Jem, I aint ever heard of a nigger snowman, I said. He wont be black long, he grunted. Jem procured some peachtree switches from the back yard, plaited them, and bent them into bones to be covered with dirt. He looks like Stephanie Crawford with her hands on her hips, I said. Fat in the middle and little-bitty arms. Ill make em bigger. Jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more dirt. He looked thoughtfully at it for a moment, then he molded a big stomach below the figures waistline. Jem glanced at me, his eyes twinkling: Mr. Averys sort of shaped like a snowman, aint he? Jem scooped up some snow and began plastering it on. He permitted me to cover only the back, saving the public parts for himself. Gradually Mr. Avery turned white. Using bits of wood for eyes, nose, mouth, and buttons, Jem succeeded in making Mr. Avery look cross. A stick of stovewood completed the picture. Jem stepped back and viewed his creation. Its lovely, Jem, I said. Looks almost like hed talk to you. It is, aint it? he said shyly. We could not wait for Atticus to come home for dinner, but called and said we had a big surprise for him. He seemed surprised when he saw most of the back yard in the front yard, but he said we had done a jim-dandy job. I didnt know how you were going to do it, he said to Jem, but from now on Ill never worry about whatll become of you, son, youll always have an idea. Jems ears reddened from Atticuss compliment, but he looked up sharply when he saw Atticus stepping back. Atticus squinted at the snowman a while. He grinned, then laughed. Son, I cant tell what youre going to bean engineer, a lawyer, or a portrait painter. Youve perpetrated a near libel here in the front yard. Weve got to disguise this fellow. Atticus suggested that Jem hone down his creations front a little, swap a broom for the stovewood, and put an apron on him. Jem explained that if he did, the snowman would become muddy and cease to be a snowman. I dont care what you do, so long as you do something, said Atticus. You cant go around making caricatures of the neighbors. Aint a characterture, said Jem. It looks just like him. Mr. Avery might not think so. I know what! said Jem. He raced across the street, disappeared into Miss Maudies back yard and returned triumphant. He stuck her sunhat on the snowmans head and jammed her hedge-clippers into the crook of his arm. Atticus said that would be fine. Miss Maudie opened her front door and came out on the porch. She looked across the street at us. Suddenly she grinned. Jem Finch, she called. You devil, bring me back my hat, sir! Jem looked up at Atticus, who shook his head. Shes just fussing, he said. Shes really impressed with youraccomplishments. Atticus strolled over to Miss Maudies sidewalk, where they engaged in an arm-waving conversation, the only phrase of which I caught was erected an absolute morphodite in that yard! Atticus, youll never raise em! The snow stopped in the afternoon, the temperature dropped, and by nightfall Mr. Averys direst predictions came true: Calpurnia kept every fireplace in the house blazing, but we were cold. When Atticus came home that evening he said we were in for it, and asked Calpurnia if she wanted to stay with us for the night. Calpurnia glanced up at the high ceilings and long windows and said she thought shed be warmer at her house. Atticus drove her home in the car. Before I went to sleep Atticus put more coal on the fire in my room. He said the thermometer registered sixteen, that it was the coldest night in his memory, and that our snowman outside was frozen solid. Minutes later, it seemed, I was awakened by someone shaking me. Atticuss overcoat was spread across me. Is it morning already? Baby, get up. Atticus was holding out my bathrobe and coat. Put your robe on first, he said. Jem was standing beside Atticus, groggy and tousled. He was holding his overcoat closed at the neck, his other hand was jammed into his pocket. He looked strangely overweight. Hurry, hon, said Atticus. Herere your shoes and socks. Stupidly, I put them on. Is it morning? No, its a little after one. Hurry now. That something was wrong finally got through to me. Whats the matter? By then he did not have to tell me. Just as the birds know where to go when it rains, I knew when there was trouble in our street. Soft taffeta-like sounds and muffled scurrying sounds filled me with helpless dread. Whose is it? Miss Maudies, hon, said Atticus gently. At the front door, we saw fire spewing from Miss Maudies diningroom windows. As if to confirm what we saw, the town fire siren wailed up the scale to a treble pitch and remained there, screaming. Its gone, aint it? moaned Jem. I expect so, said Atticus. Now listen, both of you. Go down and stand in front of the Radley Place. Keep out of the way, do you hear? See which way the winds blowing? Oh, said Jem. Atticus, reckon we oughta start moving the furniture out? Not yet, son. Do as I tell you. Run now. Take care of Scout, you hear? Dont let her out of your sight. With a push, Atticus started us toward the Radley front gate. We stood watching the street fill with men and cars while fire silently devoured Miss Maudies house. Why dont they hurry, why dont they hurry muttered Jem. We saw why. The old fire truck, killed by the cold, was being pushed from town by a crowd of men. When the men attached its hose to a hydrant, the hose burst and water shot up, tinkling down on the pavement. Oh-h Lord, Jem Jem put his arm around me. Hush, Scout, he said. It aint time to worry yet. Ill let you know when. The men of Maycomb, in all degrees of dress and undress, took furniture from Miss Maudies house to a yard across the street. I saw Atticus carrying Miss Maudies heavy oak rocking chair, and thought it sensible of him to save what she valued most. Sometimes we heard shouts. Then Mr. Averys face appeared in an upstairs window. He pushed a mattress out the window into the street and threw down furniture until men shouted, Come down from there, Dick! The stairs are going! Get outta there, Mr. Avery! Mr. Avery began climbing through the window. Scout, hes stuck breathed Jem. Oh God Mr. Avery was wedged tightly. I buried my head under Jems arm and didnt look again until Jem cried, Hes got loose, Scout! Hes all right! I looked up to see Mr. Avery cross the upstairs porch. He swung his legs over the railing and was sliding down a pillar when he slipped. He fell, yelled, and hit Miss Maudies shrubbery. Suddenly I noticed that the men were backing away from Miss Maudies house, moving down the street toward us. They were no longer carrying furniture. The fire was well into the second floor and had eaten its way to the roof: window frames were black against a vivid orange center. Jem, it looks like a pumpkin Scout, look! Smoke was rolling off our house and Miss Rachels house like fog off a riverbank, and men were pulling hoses toward them. Behind us, the fire truck from Abbottsville screamed around the curve and stopped in front of our house. That book I said. What? said Jem. That Tom Swift book, it aint mine, its Dills Dont worry, Scout, it aint time to worry yet, said Jem. He pointed. Looka yonder. In a group of neighbors, Atticus was standing with his hands in his overcoat pockets. He might have been watching a football game. Miss Maudie was beside him. See there, hes not worried yet, said Jem. Why aint he on top of one of the houses? Hes too old, hed break his neck. You think we oughta make him get our stuff out? Lets dont pester him, hell know when its time, said Jem. The Abbottsville fire truck began pumping water on our house; a man on the roof pointed to places that needed it most. I watched our Absolute Morphodite go black and crumble; Miss Maudies sunhat settled on top of the heap. I could not see her hedge- clippers. In the heat between our house, Miss Rachels and Miss Maudies, the men had long ago shed coats and bathrobes. They worked in pajama tops and nightshirts stuffed into their pants, but I became aware that I was slowly freezing where I stood. Jem tried to keep me warm, but his arm was not enough. I pulled free of it and clutched my shoulders. By dancing a little, I could feel my feet. Another fire truck appeared and stopped in front of Miss Stephanie Crawfords. There was no hydrant for another hose, and the men tried to soak her house with hand extinguishers. Miss Maudies tin roof quelled the flames. Roaring, the house collapsed; fire gushed everywhere, followed by a flurry of blankets from men on top of the adjacent houses, beating out sparks and burning chunks of wood. It was dawn before the men began to leave, first one by one, then in groups. They pushed the Maycomb fire truck back to town, the Abbottsville truck departed, the third one remained. We found out next day it had come from Clarks Ferry, sixty miles away. Jem and I slid across the street. Miss Maudie was staring at the smoking black hole in her yard, and Atticus shook his head to tell us she did not want to talk. He led us home, holding onto our shoulders to cross the icy street. He said Miss Maudie would stay with Miss Stephanie for the time being. Anybody want some hot chocolate? he asked. I shuddered when Atticus started a fire in the kitchen stove. As we drank our cocoa I noticed Atticus looking at me, first with curiosity, then with sternness. I thought I told you and Jem to stay put, he said. Why, we did. We stayed Then whose blanket is that? Blanket? Yes maam, blanket. It isnt ours. I looked down and found myself clutching a brown woolen blanket I was wearing around my shoulders, squaw-fashion. Atticus, I dont know, sir I I turned to Jem for an answer, but Jem was even more bewildered than I. He said he didnt know how it got there, we did exactly as Atticus had told us, we stood down by the Radley gate away from everybody, we didnt move an inchJem stopped. Mr. Nathan was at the fire, he babbled, I saw him, I saw him, he was tuggin that mattressAtticus, I swear Thats all right, son. Atticus grinned slowly. Looks like all of Maycomb was out tonight, in one way or another. Jem, theres some wrapping paper in the pantry, I think. Go get it and well Atticus, no sir! Jem seemed to have lost his mind. He began pouring out our secrets right and left in total disregard for my safety if not for his own, omitting nothing, knot-hole, pants and all. Mr. Nathan put cement in that tree, Atticus, an he di
 it to stop us findin things hes crazy, I reckon, like they say, but Atticus, I swear to God he aint ever harmed us, he aint ever hurt us, he coulda cut my throat from ear to ear that night but he tried to mend my pants instead he aint ever hurt us, Atticus Atticus said, Whoa, son, so gently that I was greatly heartened. It was obvious that he had not followed a word Jem said, for all Atticus said was, Youre right. Wed better keep this and the blanket to ourselves. Someday, maybe, Scout can thank him for covering her up. Thank who? I asked. Boo Radley. You were so busy looking at the fire you didnt know it when he put the blanket around you. My stomach turned to water and I nearly threw up when Jem held out the blanket and crept toward me. He sneaked out of the houseturn roundsneaked up, an went like this! Atticus said dryly, Do not let this inspire you to further glory, Jeremy. Jemscowled,Iaintgonnadoanythingtohim,butIwatchedthesparkoffresh adventure leave his eyes. Just think, Scout, he said, if youd just turned around, youda seen him. Calpurnia woke us at noon. Atticus had said we need not go to school that day, wed learn nothing after no sleep. Calpurnia said for us to try and clean up the front yard. Miss Maudies sunhat was suspended in a thin layer of ice, like a fly in amber, and we had to dig under the dirt for her hedge-clippers. We found her in her back yard, gazing at her frozen charred azaleas. Were bringing back your things, Miss Maudie, said Jem. Were awful sorry. Miss Maudie looked around, and the shadow of her old grin crossed her face. Always wanted a smaller house, Jem Finch. Gives me more yard. Just think, Ill have more room for my azaleas now! You aint grievin, Miss Maudie? I asked, surprised. Atticus said her house was nearly all she had. Grieving, child? Why, I hated that old cow barn. Thought of settin fire to it a hundred times myself, except theyd lock me up. But Dont you worry about me, Jean Louise Finch. There are ways of doing things you dont know about. Why, Ill build me a little house and take me a couple of roomers andgracious, Ill have the finest yard in Alabama. Those Bellingrathsll look plain puny when I get started! Jem and I looked at each other. Howd it catch, Miss Maudie? he asked. I dont know, Jem. Probably the flue in the kitchen. I kept a fire in there last night for my potted plants. Hear you had some unexpected company last night, Miss Jean Louise. Howd you know? Atticus told me on his way to town this morning. Tell you the truth, Id like tove been with you. And Idve had sense enough to turn around, too. Miss Maudie puzzled me. With most of her possessions gone and her beloved yard a shambles, she still took a lively and cordial interest in Jems and my affairs. She must have seen my perplexity. She said, Only thing I worried about last night was all the danger and commotion it caused. This whole neighborhood could have gone up. Mr. Averyll be in bed for a weekhes right stove up. Hes too old to do things like that and I told him so. Soon as I can get my hands clean and when Stephanie Crawfords not looking, Ill make him a Lane cake. That Stephanies been after my recipe for thirty years, and if she thinks Ill give it to her just because Im staying with her shes got another think coming. I reflected that if Miss Maudie broke down and gave it to her, Miss Stephanie couldnt follow it anyway. Miss Maudie had once let me see it: among other things, the recipe called for one large cup of sugar. It was a still day. The air was so cold and clear we heard the courthouse clock clank, rattle and strain before it struck the hour. Miss Maudies nose was a color I had never seen before, and I inquired about it. Ive been out here since six oclock, she said. Should be frozen by now. She held up her hands. A network of tiny lines crisscrossed her palms, brown with dirt and dried blood. Youve ruined em, said Jem. Why dont you get a colored man? There was no note of sacrifice in his voice when he added, Or Scoutnme, we can help you. Miss Maudie said, Thank you sir, but youve got a job of your own over there. She pointed to our yard. You mean the Morphodite? I asked. Shoot, we can rake him up in a jiffy. Miss Maudie stared down at me, her lips moving silently. Suddenly she put her hands to her head and whooped. When we left her, she was still chuckling. Jem said he didnt know what was the matter with herthat was just Miss Maudie.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch8,"That fall Maycomb endures the coldest snap since 1885, and Scout thinks the world is ending one morning when she wakes up and finds snow on the ground. Although it's only a dusting, Jem is determined to build his first snowman and sets out creatively making one out of dirt, and then using the precious white snow to cover it up. That night the temperature drops even further and all the stoves in the house are lit for warmth. Scout is awakened in the middle of the night by Atticus, who tells her Miss Maudie's house next door is on fire and they have to get out. They spend the night in front of the Radley driveway, watching the commotion. The men of Maycomb help as much as they can getting furniture out of her house while there is still time, but eventually the whole thing is up in flames. They don't go back inside the house until morning, and Scout is horrified to discover she's wrapped up in blanket and she has no idea where she got it. She almost falls over when they deduce it was Boo Radley that brought the blanket out to her in the night, and she never even knew. They're heartened to discover the next day that Miss Maudie is not grieving for her lost house, saying she always wanted a smaller one anyway."
"You can just take that back, boy! This order, given by me to Cecil Jacobs, was the beginning of a rather thin time for Jem and me. My fists were clenched and I was ready to let fly. Atticus had promised me he would wear me out if he ever heard of me fighting any more; I was far too old and too big for such childish things, and the sooner I learned to hold in, the better off everybody would be. I soon forgot. Cecil Jacobs made me forget. He had announced in the schoolyard the day before that Scout Finchs daddy defended niggers. I denied it, but told Jem. Whatd he mean sayin that? I asked. Nothing, Jem said. Ask Atticus, hell tell you. Do you defend niggers, Atticus? I asked him that evening. Of course I do. Dont say nigger, Scout. Thats common. s what everybody at school says. From now on itll be everybody less one Well if you dont want me to grow up talkin that way, why do you send me to school? My father looked at me mildly, amusement in his eyes. Despite our compromise, my campaign to avoid school had continued in one form or another since my first days dose of it: the beginning of last September had brought on sinking spells, dizziness, and mild gastric complaints. I went so far as to pay a nickel for the privilege of rubbing my head against the head of Miss Rachels cooks son, who was afflicted with a tremendous ringworm. It didnt take. But I was worrying another bone. Do all lawyers defend n-Negroes, Atticus? Of course they do, Scout. Then why did Cecil say you defended niggers? He made it sound like you were runnin a still. Atticus sighed. Im simply defending a Negrohis names Tom Robinson. He lives in that little settlement beyond the town dump. Hes a member of Calpurnias church, and Cal knows his family well. She says theyre clean-living folks. Scout, you arent old enough to understand some things yet, but theres been some high talk around town to the effect that I shouldnt do much about defending this man. Its a peculiar caseit wont come to trial until summer session. John Taylor was kind enough to give us a postponement If you shouldnt be defendin him, then why are you doin it? For a number of reasons, said Atticus. The main one is, if I didnt I couldnt hold up my head in town, I couldnt represent this county in the legislature, I couldnt even tell you or Jem not to do something again. You mean if you didnt defend that man, Jem and me wouldnt have to mind you any more? Thats about right. Why? Because I could never ask you to mind me again. Scout, simply by the nature of the work, every lawyer gets at least one case in his lifetime that affects him personally. This ones mine, I guess. You might hear some ugly talk about it at school, but do one thing for me if you will: you just hold your head high and keep those fists down. No matter what anybody says to you, dont you let em get your goat. Try fighting with your head for a change its a good one, even if it does resist learning. Atticus, are we going to win it? No, honey. Then why Simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win, Atticus said. You sound like Cousin Ike Finch, I said. Cousin Ike Finch was Maycomb Countys sole surviving Confederate veteran. He wore a General Hood type beard of which he was inordinately vain. At least once a year Atticus, Jem and I called on him, and I would have to kiss him. It was horrible. Jem and I would listen respectfully to Atticus and Cousin Ike rehash the war. Tell you, Atticus, Cousin Ike would say, the Missouri Compromise was what licked us, but if I had to go through it agin Id walk every step of the way there an every step back jist like I did before an furthermore wed whip em this time now in 1864, when Stonewall Jackson came around byI beg your pardon, young folks. Ol Blue Light was in heaven then, God rest his saintly brow Come here, Scout, said Atticus. I crawled into his lap and tucked my head under his chin. He put his arms around me and rocked me gently. Its different this time, he said. This time we arent fighting the Yankees, were fighting our friends. But remember this, no matter how bitter things get, theyre still our friends and this is still our home. With this in mind, I faced Cecil Jacobs in the schoolyard next day: You gonna take that back, boy? You gotta make me first! he yelled. My folks said your daddy was a disgrace an that nigger oughta hang from the water-tank! I drew a bead on him, remembered what Atticus had said, then dropped my fists and walked away, Scouts a cowward! ringing in my ears. It was the first time I ever walked away from afight. Somehow, if I fought Cecil I would let Atticus down. Atticus so rarely asked Jem and me to do something for him, I could take being called a coward for him. I felt extremely noble for having remembered, and remained noble for three weeks. Then Christmas came and disasterstruck.  Jem and I viewed Christmas with mixed feelings. The good side was the tree and Uncle Jack Finch. Every Christmas Eve day we met Uncle Jack at Maycomb Junction, and he would spend a week with us. A flip of the coin revealed the uncompromising lineaments of Aunt Alexandra and Francis. I suppose I should include Uncle Jimmy, Aunt Alexandras husband, but as he never spoke a word to me in my life except to say, Get off the fence, once, I never saw any reason to take notice of him. Neither did Aunt Alexandra. Long ago, in a burst of friendliness, Aunty and Uncle Jimmy produced a son named Henry, who left home as soon as was humanly possible, married, and produced Francis. Henry and his wife deposited Francis at his grandparents every Christmas, then pursued their own pleasures. No amount of sighing could induce Atticus to let us spend Christmas day at home. We went to Finchs Landing every Christmas in my memory. The fact that Aunty was a good cook was some compensation for being forced to spend a religious holiday with Francis Hancock. He was a year older than I, and I avoided him on principle: he enjoyed everything I disapproved of, and disliked my ingenuous diversions. Aunt Alexandra was Atticuss sister, but when Jem told me about changelings and siblings, I decided that she had been swapped at birth, that my grandparents had perhaps received a Crawford instead of a Finch. Had I ever harbored the mystical notions about mountains that seem to obsess lawyers and judges, Aunt Alexandra would have been analogous to Mount Everest: throughout my early life, she was cold and there. When Uncle Jack jumped down from the train Christmas Eve day, we had to wait for the porter to hand him two long packages. Jem and I always thought it funny when Uncle Jack pecked Atticus on the cheek; they were the only two men we ever saw kiss each other. Uncle Jack shook hands with Jem and swung me high, but not high enough: Uncle Jack was a head shorter than Atticus; the baby of the family, he was younger than Aunt Alexandra. He and Aunty looked alike, but Uncle Jack made better use of his face: we were never wary of his sharp nose andchin. He was one of the few men of science who never terrified me, probably because he never behaved like a doctor. Whenever he performed a minor service for Jem and me, as removing a splinter from a foot, he would tell us exactly what he was going to do, give us an estimation of how much it would hurt, and explain the use of any tongs he employed. One Christmas I lurked in corners nursing a twisted splinter in my foot, permitting no one to come near me. When Uncle Jack caught me, he kept me laughing about a preacher who hated going to church so much that every day he stood at his gate in his dressing-gown, smoking a hookah and delivering five-minute sermons to any passers-by who desired spiritual comfort. I interrupted to make Uncle Jack let me know when he would pull it out, but he held up a bloody splinter in a pair of tweezers and said he yanked it while I was laughing, that was what was known as relativity. Whats in those packages? I asked him, pointing to the long thin parcels the porter had given him. None of your business, he said. Jem said, Hows Rose Aylmer? Rose Aylmer was Uncle Jacks cat. She was a beautiful yellow female Uncle Jack said was one of the few women he could stand permanently. He reached into his coat pocket and brought out some snapshots. We admired them. Shes gettin fat, I said. I should think so. She eats all the leftover fingers and ears from the hospital. Aw, thats a damn story, I said. I beg your pardon? Atticus said, Dont pay any attention to her, Jack. Shes trying you out. Cal says shes been cussing fluently for a week, now. Uncle Jack raised his eyebrows and said nothing. I was proceeding on the dim theory, aside from the innate attractiveness of such words, that if Atticus discovered I had picked them up at school he wouldnt make me go. But at supper that evening when I asked him to pass the damn ham, please, Uncle Jack pointed at me. See me afterwards, young lady, he said. When supper was over, Uncle Jack went to the livingroom and sat down. He slapped his thighs for me to come sit on his lap. I liked to smell him: he was like a bottle of alcohol and something pleasantly sweet. He pushed back my bangs and looked at me. Youre more like Atticus than your mother, he said. Youre also growing out of your pants a little. I reckon they fit all right. You like words like damn and hell now, dont you? I said I reckoned so. Well I dont, said Uncle Jack, not unless theres extreme provocation connected with em. Ill be here a week, and I dont want to hear any words like that while Im here. Scout, youll get in trouble if you go around saying things like that. You want to grow up to be a lady, dont you? I said not particularly. Of course you do. Now lets get to the tree. We decorated the tree until bedtime, and that night I dreamed of the two long packages for Jem and me. Next morning Jem and I dived for them: they were from Atticus, who had written Uncle Jack to get them for us, and they were what we had asked for. Dont point them in the house, said Atticus, when Jem aimed at a picture on the wall. Youll have to teach em to shoot, said Uncle Jack. Thats your job, said Atticus. I merely bowed to the inevitable. It took Atticuss courtroom voice to drag us away from the tree. He declined to let us take our air rifles to the Landing (I had already begun to think of shooting Francis) and said if we made one false move hed take them away from us for good. Finchs Landing consisted of three hundred and sixty-six steps down a high bluff and ending in a jetty. Farther down stream, beyond the bluff, were traces of an old cotton landing, where Finch Negroes had loaded bales and produce, unloaded blocks of ice, flour and sugar, farm equipment, and feminine apparel. A two-rut road ran from the riverside and vanished among dark trees. At the end of the road was a two-storied white house with porches circling it upstairs and downstairs. In his old age, our ancestor Simon Finch had built it to please his nagging wife; but with the porches all resemblance to ordinary houses of its era ended. The internal arrangements of the Finch house were indicative of Simons guilelessness and the absolute trust with which he regarded his offspring. There were six bedrooms upstairs, four for the eight female children, one for Welcome Finch, the sole son, and one for visiting relatives. Simple enough; but the daughters rooms could be reached only by one staircase, Welcomes room and the guestroom only by another. The Daughters Staircase was in the ground-floor bedroom of their parents, so Simon always knew the hours of his daughters nocturnal comings and goings. There was a kitchen separate from the rest of the house, tacked onto it by a wooden catwalk; in the back yard was a rusty bell on a pole, used to summon field hands or as a distress signal; a widows walk was on the roof, but no widows walked therefrom it, Simon oversaw his overseer, watched the river-boats, and gazed into the lives of surrounding landholders. There went with the house the usual legend about the Yankees: one Finch female, recently engaged, donned her complete trousseau to save it from raiders in the neighborhood; she became stuck in the door to the Daughters Staircase but was doused with water and finally pushed through. When we arrived at the Landing, Aunt Alexandra kissed Uncle Jack, Francis kissed Uncle Jack, Uncle Jimmy shook hands silently with Uncle Jack, Jem and I gave our presents to Francis, who gave us a present. Jem felt his age and gravitated to the adults, leaving me to entertain our cousin. Francis was eight and slicked back hishair. Whatd you get for Christmas? I asked politely. Just what I asked for, he said. Francis had requested a pair of knee-pants, a red leather booksack, five shirts and an untied bow tie. Thats nice, I lied. Jem and me got air rifles, and Jem got a chemistry set A toy one, I reckon. No, a real one. Hes gonna make me some invisible ink, and Im gonna write to Dill in it. Francis asked what was the use of that. Well, cant you just see his face when he gets a letter from me with nothing in it? Itll drive him nuts. Talking to Francis gave me the sensation of settling slowly to the bottom of the ocean. He was the most boring child I ever met. As he lived in Mobile, he could not inform on me to school authorities, but he managed to tell everything he knew to Aunt Alexandra, who in turn unburdened herself to Atticus, who either forgot it or gave me hell, whichever struck his fancy. But the only time I ever heard Atticus speak sharply to anyone was when I once heard him say, Sister, I do the best I can with them! It had something to do with my going around in overalls. Aunt Alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire. I could not possibly hope to be a lady if I wore breeches; when I said I could do nothing in a dress, she said I wasnt supposed to be doing things that required pants. Aunt Alexandras vision of my deportment involved playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing the Add-A-Pearl necklace she gave me when I was born; furthermore, I should be a ray of sunshine in my fathers lonely life. I suggested that one could be a ray of sunshine in pants just as well, but Aunty said that one had to behave like a sunbeam, that I was born good but had grown progressively worse every year. She hurt my feelings and set my teeth permanently on edge, but when I asked Atticus about it, he said there were already enough sunbeams in the family and to go on about my business, he didnt mind me much the way I was. At Christmas dinner, I sat at the little table in the diningroom; Jem and Francis sat with the adults at the dining table. Aunty had continued to isolate me long after Jem and Francis graduated to the big table. I often wondered what she thought Id do, get up and throw something? I sometimes thought of asking her if she would let me sit at the big table with the rest of them just once, I would prove to her how civilized I could be; after all, I ate at home every day with no major mishaps. When I begged Atticus to use his influence, he said he had nonewe were guests, and we sat where she told us to sit. He also said Aunt Alexandra didnt understand girls much, shed never had one. But her cooking made up for everything: three kinds of meat, summer vegetables from her pantry shelves; peach pickles, two kinds of cake and ambrosia constituted a modest Christmas dinner. Afterwards, the adults made for the livingroom and sat around in a dazed condition. Jem lay on the floor, and I went to the back yard. Put on your coat, said Atticus dreamily, so I didnt hear him. Francis sat beside me on the back steps. That was the best yet, I said. Grandmas a wonderful cook, said Francis. Shes gonna teach me how. Boys dont cook. I giggled at the thought of Jem in an apron. Grandma says all men should learn to cook, that men oughta be careful with their wives and wait on em when they dont feel good, said my cousin. I dont want Dill waitin on me, I said. Id rather wait on him. Dill? Yeah. Dont say anything about it yet, bu
 were gonna get married as soon as were big enough. He asked me last summer. Francis hooted. Whats the matter with him? I asked. Aint anything the matter with him. You mean that little runt Grandma says stays with Miss Rachel every summer? Thats exactly who I mean. I know all about him, said Francis. What about him? Grandma says he hasnt got a home Has too, he lives in Meridian. he just gets passed around from relative to relative, and Miss Rachel keeps him every summer. Francis, thats not so! Francis grinned at me. Youre mighty dumb sometimes, Jean Louise. Guess you dont know any better, though. What do you mean? If Uncle Atticus lets you run around with stray dogs, thats his own business, like Grandma says, so it aint your fault. I guess it aint your fault if Uncle Atticus is a nigger- lover besides, but Im here to tell you it certainly does mortify the rest of the family Francis, what the hell do youmean? JustwhatIsaid.Grandmasaysitsbadenoughheletsyouallrunwild,butnowhes turned out a nigger-lover well never be able to walk the streets of Maycomb agin. Hes ruinin the family, thats what hesdoin. Francis rose and sprinted down the catwalk to the old kitchen. At a safe distance he called, Hes nothin but a nigger-lover! He is not! I roared. I dont know what youre talkin about, but you better cut it out this red hot minute! I leaped off the steps and ran down the catwalk. It was easy to collar Francis. I said take it back quick. Francis jerked loose and sped into the old kitchen. Nigger-lover! he yelled. When stalking ones prey, it is best to take ones time. Say nothing, and as sure as eggs he will become curious and emerge. Francis appeared at the kitchen door. You still mad, Jean Louise? he asked tentatively. Nothing to speak of, I said. Francis came out on the catwalk. You gonna take it back, Fraancis? But I was too quick on the draw. Francis shot back into the kitchen, so I retired to the steps. I could wait patiently. I had sat there perhaps five minutes when I heard Aunt Alexandra speak: Wheres Francis? Hes out yonder in the kitchen. He knows hes not supposed to play in there. Francis came to the door and yelled, Grandma, shes got me in here and she wont let me out! What is all this, Jean Louise? I looked up at Aunt Alexandra. I havent got him in there, Aunty, I aint holdin him. Yes she is, shouted Francis, she wont let me out! Have you all been fussing? Jean Louise got mad at me, Grandma, called Francis. Francis, come out of there! Jean Louise, if I hear another word out of you Ill tell your father. Did I hear you say hell a while ago? Nome. I thought I did. Id better not hear it again. Aunt Alexandra was a back-porch listener. The moment she was out of sight Francis came out head up and grinning. Dont you fool with me, he said. He jumped into the yard and kept his distance, kicking tufts of grass, turning around occasionally to smile at me. Jem appeared on the porch, looked at us, and went away. Francis climbed the mimosa tree, came down, put his hands in his pockets and strolled around the yard. Hah! he said. I asked him who he thought he was, Uncle Jack? Francis said he reckoned I got told, for me to just sit there and leave him alone. I aint botherin you, I said. Francis looked at me carefully, concluded that I had been sufficiently subdued, and crooned softly, Nigger-lover This time, I split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth. My left impaired, I sailed in with my right, but not for long. Uncle Jack pinned my arms to my sides and said, Stand still! Aunt Alexandra ministered to Francis, wiping his tears away with her handkerchief, rubbing his hair, patting his cheek. Atticus, Jem, and Uncle Jimmy had come to the back porch when Francis started yelling. Who started this? said Uncle Jack. Francis and I pointed at each other. Grandma, he bawled, she called me a whore- lady and jumped on me! Is that true, Scout? said Uncle Jack. I reckon so. When Uncle Jack looked down at me, his features were like Aunt Alexandras. You know I told you youd get in trouble if you used words like that? I told you, didnt I? Yes sir, but Well, youre in trouble now. Stay there. I was debating whether to stand there or run, and tarried in indecision a moment too long: I turned to flee but Uncle Jack was quicker. I found myself suddenly looking at a tiny ant struggling with a bread crumb in the grass. Ill never speak to you again as long as I live! I hate you an despise you an hope you die tomorrow! A statement that seemed to encourage Uncle Jack, more than anything. I ran to Atticus for comfort, but he said I had it coming and it was high time we went home. I climbed into the back seat of the car without saying good-bye to anyone, and at home I ran to my room and slammed the door. Jem tried to say something nice, but I wouldnt lethim. When I surveyed the damage there were only seven or eight red marks, and I was reflecting upon relativity when someone knocked on the door. I asked who it was; Uncle Jack answered. Go away! Uncle Jack said if I talked like that hed lick me again, so I was quiet. When he entered the room I retreated to a corner and turned my back on him. Scout, he said, do you still hate me? Go on, please sir. Why, I didnt think youd hold it against me, he said. Im disappointed in youyou had that coming and you know it. Didnt either. Honey, you cant go around calling people You aint fair, I said, you aint fair. Uncle Jacks eyebrows went up. Not fair? How not? Youre real nice, Uncle Jack, an I reckon I love you even after what you did, but you dont understand children much. Uncle Jack put his hands on his hips and looked down at me. And why do I not understand children, Miss Jean Louise? Such conduct as yours required little understanding. It was obstreperous, disorderly and abusive You gonna give me a chance to tell you? I dont mean to sass you, Im just tryin to tell you. Uncle Jack sat down on the bed. His eyebrows came together, and he peered up at me from under them. Proceed, he said. I took a deep breath. Well, in the first place you never stopped to gimme a chance to tell you my side of ityou just lit right into me. When Jem an I fuss Atticus doesnt ever just listen to Jems side of it, he hears mine too, an in the second place you told me never to use words like that except in ex-extreme provocation, and Francis provocated me enough to knock his block off Uncle Jack scratched his head. What was your side of it, Scout? Francis called Atticus somethin, an I wasnt about to take it off him. What did Francis call him? A nigger-lover. I aint very sure what it means, but the way Francis said ittell you one thing right now, Uncle Jack, Ill beI swear before God if Ill sit there and let him say somethin about Atticus. He called Atticus that? Yes sir, he did, an a lot more. Said Atticusd be the ruination of the family an he let Jem an me run wild From the look on Uncle Jacks face, I thought I was in for it again. When he said, Well see about this, I knew Francis was in for it. Ive a good mind to go out there tonight. Please sir, just let it go. Please. Ive no intention of letting it go, he said. Alexandra should know about this. The idea ofwaitll I get my hands on that boy Uncle Jack, please promise me somethin, please sir. Promise you wont tell Atticus about this. Hehe asked me one time not to let anything I heard about him make me mad, an Id ruther him think we were fightin about somethin else instead. Please promise But I dont like Francis getting away with something like that He didnt. You reckon you could tie up my hand? Its still bleedin some. Of course I will, baby. I know of no hand I would be more delighted to tie up. Will you come this way? Uncle Jack gallantly bowed me to the bathroom. While he cleaned and bandaged my knuckles, he entertained me with a tale about a funny nearsighted old gentleman who had a cat named Hodge, and who counted all the cracks in the sidewalk when he went to town. There now, he said. Youll have a very unladylike scar on your wedding-ring finger. Thank you sir. Uncle Jack? Maam? Whats a whore-lady? Uncle Jack plunged into another long tale about an old Prime Minister who sat in the House of Commons and blew feathers in the air and tried to keep them there when all about him men were losing their heads. I guess he was trying to answer my question, but he made no sense whatsoever. Later, when I was supposed to be in bed, I went down the hall for a drink of water and heard Atticus and Uncle Jack in the livingroom: I shall never marry, Atticus. Why? I might have children. Atticus said, Youve a lot to learn, Jack. I know. Your daughter gave me my first lessons this afternoon. She said I didnt understand children much and told me why. She was quite right. Atticus, she told me how I should have treated heroh dear, Im so sorry I romped on her. Atticus chuckled. She earned it, so dont feel too remorseful. I waited, on tenterhooks, for Uncle Jack to tell Atticus my side of it. But he didnt. He simply murmured, Her use of bathroom invective leaves nothing to the imagination. But she doesnt know the meaning of half she saysshe asked me what a whore-lady was Did you tell her? No, I told her about Lord Melbourne. Jack! When a child asks you something, answer him, for goodness sake. But dont make a production of it. Children are children, but they can spot an evasion quicker than adults, and evasion simply muddles em. No, my father mused, you had the right answer this afternoon, but the wrong reasons. Bad language is a stage all children go through, and it dies with time when they learn theyre not attracting attention with it. Hotheadedness isnt. Scouts got to learn to keep her head and learn soon, with whats in store for her these next few months. Shes coming along, though. Jems getting older and she follows his example a good bit now. All she needs is assistance sometimes. Atticus, youve never laid a hand on her. I admit that. So far Ive been able to get by with threats. Jack, she minds me as well as she can. Doesnt come up to scratch half the time, but she tries. Thats not the answer, said Uncle Jack. No, the answer is she knows I know she tries. Thats what makes the difference. What bothers me is that she and Jem will have to absorb some ugly things pretty soon. Im not worried about Jem keeping his head, but Scoutd just as soon jump on someone as look at him if her prides at stake I waited for Uncle Jack to break his promise. He still didnt. Atticus, how bad is this going to be? You havent had too much chance to discuss it. It couldnt be worse, Jack. The only thing weve got is a black mans word against the Ewells. The evidence boils down to you-didI-didnt. The jury couldnt possibly be expected to take Tom Robinsons word against the Ewellsare you acquainted with the Ewells? Uncle Jack said yes, he remembered them. He described them to Atticus, but Atticus said, Youre a generation off. The present ones are the same, though. What are you going to do, then? Before Im through, I intend to jar the jury a bitI think well have a reasonable chance on appeal, though. I really cant tell at this stage, Jack. You know, Id hoped to get through life without a case of this kind, but John Taylor pointed at me and said, Youre It. Let this cup pass from you, eh? Right. But do you think I could face my children otherwise? You know whats going to happen as well as I do, Jack, and I hope and pray I can get Jem and Scout through it without bitterness, and most of all, without catching Maycombs usual disease. Why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a Negro comes up, is something I dont pretend to understand I just hope that Jem and Scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town. I hope they trust me enough Jean Louise? My scalp jumped. I stuck my head around the corner. Sir? Go to bed. I scurried to my room and went to bed. Uncle Jack was a prince of a fellow not to let me down. But I never figured out how Atticus knew I was listening, and it was not until many years later that I realized he wanted me to hear every word he said.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch9,"As the school year progresses Scout begins to get teased at school over her father, atticus is called a ""Nigger Defender"" and one night she asks Atticus why people are talking about him. He tells her that's he's taken on a case that affects him personally and because he is defending this man, Tom Robinson, there is a big stink about it in town. Atticus asks Scout that, no matter what she hears, she's not to get into a fight with someone over this case. True to her word, she doesn't fight, even when antagonized at school. Until Christmas. Their Uncle Jack Finch comes down from Boston, which is the good part of Christmas. The bad part is that they all have to spend Christmas day at Aunt Alexandra's house at Finch's Landing. Even worse, their cousin Francis is there, and Scout hates him. Things go smoothly until after dinner when, alone in the backyard with Scout, Francis starts calling Atticus all sorts of terrible names because he's defending a black man. Scout sails in with her fists to defend him and gets caught by Uncle Jack. She doesn't have a moment to tell her side of the story, and moments later they're on their way back home. She's finally able to tell her story to Uncle Jack later that night, and he apologizes for jumping all over her when he should've been punishing Francis."
"Atticus was feeble: he was nearly fifty. When Jem and I asked him why he was so old, he said he got started late, which we felt reflected upon his abilities and manliness. He was much older than the parents of our school contemporaries, and there was nothing Jem or I could say about him when our classmates said, My father Jem was football crazy. Atticus was never too tired to play keep-away, but when Jem wanted to tackle him Atticus would say, Im too old for that, son. Our father didnt do anything. He worked in an office, not in a drugstore. Atticus did not drive a dump-truck for the county, he was not the sheriff, he did not farm, work in a garage, or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of anyone. Besides that, he wore glasses. He was nearly blind in his left eye, and said left eyes were the tribal curse of the Finches. Whenever he wanted to see something well, he turned his head and looked from his right eye. He did not do the things our schoolmates fathers did: he never went hunting, he did not play poker or fish or drink or smoke. He sat in the livingroom and read. With these attributes, however, he would not remain as inconspicuous as we wished him to: that year, the school buzzed with talk about him defending Tom Robinson, none of which was complimentary. After my bout with Cecil Jacobs when I committed myself to a policy of cowardice, word got around that Scout Finch wouldnt fight any more, her daddy wouldnt let her. This was not entirely correct: I wouldnt fight publicly for Atticus, but the family was private ground. I would fight anyone from a third cousin upwards tooth and nail. Francis Hancock, for example, knew that. When he gave us our air-rifles Atticus wouldnt teach us to shoot. Uncle Jack instructed us in the rudiments thereof; he said Atticus wasnt interested in guns. Atticus said to Jem one day, Id rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard, but I know youll go after birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit em, but remember its a sin to kill amockingbird. That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. Your fathers right, she said. Mockingbirds dont do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They dont eat up peoples gardens, dont nest in corncribs, they dont do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. Thats why its a sin to kill a mockingbird. Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, aint it? Been here longer than the town. Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and mes the only children around here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachels old and so are you and Atticus. I dont call fifty very old, said Miss Maudie tartly. Not being wheeled around yet, am I? Neithers your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to burn down that old mausoleum of mine, Im too old to keep it upmaybe youre right, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. Youve never been around young folks much, have you? Yessum, at school. I mean young grown-ups. Youre lucky, you know. You and Jem have the benefit of your fathers age. If your father was thirty youd find life quite different. I sure would. Atticus cant do anything Youd be surprised, said Miss Maudie. Theres life in him yet. What can he do? Well, he can make somebodys will so airtight cant anybody meddle with it. Shoot Well, did you know hes the best checker-player in this town? Why, down at the Landing when we were coming up, Atticus Finch could beat everybody on both sides of the river. Good Lord, Miss Maudie, Jem and me beat him all the time. Its about time you found out its because he lets you. Did you know he can play a Jews Harp? This modest accomplishment served to make me even more ashamed of him. Well she said. Well, what, Miss Maudie? Well nothing. Nothingit seems with all that youd be proud of him. Cant everybody play a Jews Harp. Now keep out of the way of the carpenters. Youd better go home, Ill be in my azaleas and cant watch you. Plank might hit you. I went to the back yard and found Jem plugging away at a tin can, which seemed stupid with all the bluejays around. I returned to the front yard and busied myself for two hours erecting a complicated breastworks at the side of the porch, consisting of a tire, an orange crate, the laundry hamper, the porch chairs, and a small U.S. flag Jem gave me from a popcorn box. When Atticus came home to dinner he found me crouched down aiming across the street. What are you shooting at? Miss Maudies rear end. Atticus turned and saw my generous target bending over her bushes. He pushed his hat to the back of his head and crossed the street. Maudie, he called, I thought Id better warn you. Youre in considerable peril. Miss Maudie straightened up and looked toward me. She said, Atticus, you are a devil from hell. When Atticus returned he told me to break camp. Dont you ever let me catch you pointing that gun at anybody again, he said. I wished my father was a devil from hell. I sounded out Calpurnia on the subject. Mr. Finch? Why, he can do lots of things. Like what? I asked. Calpurnia scratched her head. Well, I dont rightly know, she said. Jem underlined it when he asked Atticus if he was going out for the Methodists and Atticus said hed break his neck if he did, he was just too old for that sort of thing. The Methodists were trying to pay off their church mortgage, and had challenged the Baptists to a game of touch football. Everybody in towns father was playing, it seemed, except Atticus. Jem said he didnt even want to go, but he was unable to resist football in any form, and he stood gloomily on the sidelines with Atticus and me watching Cecil Jacobss father make touchdowns for the Baptists. One Saturday Jem and I decided to go exploring with our air-rifles to see if we could find a rabbit or a squirrel. We had gone about five hundred yards beyond the Radley Place when I noticed Jem squinting at something down the street. He had turned his head to one side and was looking out of the corners of his eyes. Whatcha looking at? That old dog down yonder, he said. Thats old Tim Johnson, aint it? Yeah. Tim Johnson was the property of Mr. Harry Johnson who drove the Mobile bus and lived on the southern edge of town. Tim was a liver-colored bird dog, the pet of Maycomb. Whats he doing? I dont know, Scout. We better go home. Aw Jem, its February. I dont care, Im gonna tell Cal. We raced home and ran to the kitchen. Cal, said Jem, can you come down the sidewalk a minute? What for, Jem? I cant come down the sidewalk every time you want me. Theres somethin wrong with an old dog down yonder. Calpurnia sighed. I cant wrap up any dogs foot now. Theres some gauze in the bathroom, go get it and do it yourself. Jem shook his head. Hes sick, Cal. Somethings wrong with him. Whats he doin, trying to catch his tail? No, hes doin like this. Jem gulped like a goldfish, hunched his shoulders and twitched his torso. Hes goin like that, only not like he means to. Are you telling me a story, Jem Finch? Calpurnias voice hardened. No Cal, I swear Im not. Was he runnin? No, hes just moseyin along, so slow you cant hardly tell it. Hes comin this way. Calpurnia rinsed her hands and followed Jem into the yard. I dont see any dog, she said. She followed us beyond the Radley Place and looked where Jem pointed. Tim Johnson was not much more than a speck in the distance, but he was closer to us. He walked erratically, as if his right legs were shorter than his left legs. He reminded me of a car stuck in a sandbed. Hes gone lopsided, said Jem. Calpurnia stared, then grabbed us by the shoulders and ran us home. She shut the wood door behind us, went to the telephone and shouted, Gimme Mr. Finchs office! Mr. Finch! she shouted. This is Cal. I swear to God theres a mad dog down the street a piecehes comin this way, yes sir, hesMr. Finch, I declare he isold Tim Johnson, yes sir yessir yes She hung up and shook her head when we tried to ask her what Atticus had said. She rattled the telephone hook and said, Miss Eula Maynow maam, Im through talkin to Mr. Finch, please dont connect me no morelisten, Miss Eula May, can you call Miss Rachel and Miss Stephanie Crawford and whoevers got a phone on this street and tell em a mad dogs comin? Please maam! Calpurnia listened. I know its February, Miss Eula May, but I know a mad dog when I see one. Please maam hurry! Calpurnia asked Jem, Radleys got a phone? Jem looked in the book and said no. They wont come out anyway, Cal. I dont care, Im gonna tell em. She ran to the front porch, Jem and I at her heels. You stay in that house! she yelled. Calpurnias message had been received by the neighborhood. Every wood door within our range of vision was closed tight. We saw no trace of Tim Johnson. We watched Calpurnia running toward the Radley Place, holding her skirt and apron above her knees. She went up to the front steps and banged on the door. She got no answer, and she shouted, Mr. Nathan, Mr. Arthur, mad dogs comin! Mad dogs comin! Shes supposed to go around in back, I said. Jem shook his head. Dont make any difference now, he said. Calpurnia pounded on the door in vain. No one acknowledged her warning; no one seemed to have heard it. As Calpurnia sprinted to the back porch a black Ford swung into the driveway. Atticus and Mr. Heck Tate got out. Mr. Heck Tate was the sheriff of Maycomb County. He was as tall as Atticus, but thinner. He was long-nosed, wore boots with shiny metal eye-holes, boot pants and a lumber jacket. His belt had a row of bullets sticking in it. He carried a heavy rifle. When he and Atticus reached the porch, Jem opened the door. Stay inside, son, said Atticus. Where is he, Cal? He oughta be here by now, said Calpurnia, pointing down the street. Not runnin, is he? asked Mr. Tate. Naw sir, hes in the twitchin stage, Mr. Heck. Should we go after him, Heck? asked Atticus. We better wait, Mr. Finch. They usually go in a straight line, but you never can tell. He might follow the curvehope he does or hell go straight in the Radley back yard. Lets wait a minute. Dont think hell get in the Radley yard, said Atticus. Fencell stop him. Hell probably follow the road I thought mad dogs foamed at the mouth, galloped, leaped and lunged at throats, and I thought they did it in August. Had Tim Johnson behaved thus, I would have been less frightened. Nothing is more deadly than a deserted, waiting street. The trees were still, the mockingbirds were silent, the carpenters at Miss Maudies house had vanished. I heard Mr. Tate sniff, then blow his nose. I saw him shift his gun to the crook of his arm. I saw Miss Stephanie Crawfords face framed in the glass window of her front door. Miss Maudie appeared and stood beside her. Atticus put his foot on the rung of a chair and rubbed his hand slowly down the side of his thigh. There he is, he said softly. Tim Johnson came into sight, walking dazedly in the inner rim of the curve parallel to the Radley house. Look at him, whispered Jem. Mr. Heck said they walked in a straight line. He cant even stay in the road. He looks more sick than anything, I said. Let anything get in front of him and hell come straight at it. Mr. Tate put his hand to his forehead and leaned forward. Hes got it all right, Mr. Finch. Tim Johnson was advancing at a snails pace, but he was not playing or sniffing at foliage: he seemed dedicated to one course and motivated by an invisible force that was inching him toward us. We could see him shiver like a horse shedding flies; his jaw opened and shut; he was alist, but he was being pulled gradually toward us. Hes lookin for a place to die, said Jem. Mr. Tate turned around. Hes far from dead, Jem, he hasnt got started yet. Tim Johnson reached the side street that ran in front of the Radley Place, and what remained of his poor mind made him pause and seem to consider which road he would take. He made a few hesitant steps and stopped in front of the Radley gate; then he tried to turn around, but was having difficulty. Atticus said, Hes within range, Heck. You better get him before he goes down the side streetLord knows whos around the corner. Go inside, Cal. Calpurnia opened the screen door, latched it behind her, then unlatched it and held onto the hook. She tried to block Jem and me with her body, but we looked out from beneath her arms. Take him, Mr. Finch. Mr. Tate handed the rifle to Atticus; Jem and I nearly fainted. Dont waste time, Heck, said Atticus. Go on. Mr. Finch, this is a one-shot job. Atticus shook his head vehemently: Dont just stand there, Heck! He wont wait all day for you For Gods sake, Mr. Finch, look where he is! Miss and youll go straight into the Radley house! I cant shoot that well and you know it! I havent shot a gun in thirty years Mr. Tate almost threw the rifle at Atticus. Id feel mighty comfortable if you did now, he said. In a fog, Jem and I watched our father take the gun and walk out into the middle of the street. He walked quickly, but I thought he moved like an underwater swimmer: time had slowed to a nauseating crawl. When Atticus raised his glasses Calpurnia murmured, Sweet Jesus help him, and put her hands to her cheeks. Atticus pushed his glasses to his forehead; they slipped down, and he dropped them in the street. In the silence, I heard them crack. Atticus rubbed his eyes and chin; we saw him blink hard. In front of the Radley gate, Tim Johnson had made up what was left of his mind. He had finally turned himself around, to pursue his original course up our street. He made two steps forward, then stopped and raised his head. We saw his body go rigid. With movements so swift they seemed simultaneous, Atticuss hand yanked a ball- tipped lever as he brought the gun to his shoulder. The rifle cracked. Tim Johnson leaped, flopped over and crumpled on the sidewalk in a brown-and-white heap. He didnt know what hit him. Mr. Tate jumped off the porch and ran to the Radley Place. He stopped in front of the dog, squatted, turned around and tapped his finger on his forehead above his left eye. You were a little to the right, Mr. Finch, he called. Always was, answered Atticus. If I had my druthers Id take a shotgun. He stooped and picked up his glasses, ground the broken lenses to powder under his heel, and went to Mr. Tate and stood looking down at Tim Johnson. Doors opened one by one, and the neighborhood slowly came alive. Miss Maudie walked down the steps with Miss Stephanie Crawford. Jem was paralyzed. I pinched him to get him moving, but when Atticus saw us coming he called, Stay where you are. When Mr. Tate and Atticus returned to the yard, Mr. Tate was smiling. Ill have Zeebo collect him, he said. You havent forgot much, Mr. Finch. They say it never leaves you. Atticus was silent. Atticus? said Jem. Yes? Nothin. I saw that, One-Shot Finch! Atticus wheeled around and faced Miss Maudie. They looked at one another without saying anything, and Atticus got into the sheriffs car. Come here, he said to Jem. Dont you go near that dog, you understand? Dont go near him, hes just as dangerous dead as alive. Yes sir, said Jem. Atticus What,son? Nothing. Whats the matter with you, boy, cant you talk? said Mr. Tate, grinning at Jem. Didnt you know your daddys Hush, Heck, said Atticus, lets go back to town. When they drove away, Jem and I went to Miss Stephanies front steps. We sat waiting for Zeebo to arrive in the garbage truck. Jem sat in numb confusion, and Miss Stephanie said, Uh, uh, uh, whoda thought of a mad dog in February? Maybe he wadnt mad, maybe he was just crazy. Id hate to see Harry Johnsons face when he gets in from the Mobile run and finds Atticus Finchs shot his dog. Bet he was just full of fleas from somewhere Miss Maudie said Miss Stephanied be singing a different tune if Tim Johnson was still coming up the street, that theyd find out soon enough, theyd send his head to Montgomery. Jem became vaguely art
culate: d you see him, Scout? d you see him just standin there? n all of a sudden he just relaxed all over, an it looked like that gun was a part of him an he did it so quick, like I hafta aim for ten minutes fore I can hit somethin Miss Maudie grinned wickedly. Well now, Miss Jean Louise, she said, still think your father cant do anything? Still ashamed of him? Nome, I said meekly. Forgot to tell you the other day that besides playing the Jews Harp, Atticus Finch was the deadest shot in Maycomb County in his time. Dead shot echoed Jem. Thats what I said, Jem Finch. Guess youll change your tune now. The very idea, didnt you know his nickname was Ol One-Shot when he was a boy? Why, down at the Landing when he was coming up, if he shot fifteen times and hit fourteen doves hed complain about wasting ammunition. He never said anything about that, Jem muttered. Never said anything about it, did he? No maam. Wonder why he never goes huntin now, I said. Maybe I can tell you, said Miss Maudie. If your fathers anything, hes civilized in his heart. Marksmanships a gift of God, a talentoh, you have to practice to make it perfect, but shootins different from playing the piano or the like. I think maybe he put his gun down when he realized that God had given him an unfair advantage over most living things. I guess he decided he wouldnt shoot till he had to, and he had totoday. Looks like hed be proud of it, I said. People in their right minds never take pride in their talents, said Miss Maudie. We saw Zeebo drive up. He took a pitchfork from the back of the garbage truck and gingerly lifted Tim Johnson. He pitched the dog onto the truck, then poured something from a gallon jug on and around the spot where Tim fell. Dont yawl come over here for a while, he called. When we went home I told Jem wed really have something to talk about at school on Monday. Jem turned on me. Dont say anything about it, Scout, he said. What? I certainly am. Aint everybodys daddy the deadest shot in Maycomb County. Jem said, I reckon if hed wanted us to know it, heda told us. If he was proud of it, heda told us. Maybe it just slipped his mind, I said. Naw, Scout, its something you wouldnt understand. Atticus is real old, but I wouldnt care if he couldnt do anythingI wouldnt care if he couldnt do a blessed thing. Jem picked up a rock and threw it jubilantly at the carhouse. Running after it, he called back: Atticus is a gentleman, just like me!",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch10,"The neighborhood excitement starts up again in February when Tim Johnson, a mangy dog owned by a man on the other side of town, is discovered walking up the street with rabies. The sheriff is called and he and Atticus drive up with a gun to shoot it. Scout and Jem watch in amazement as their father, whom they've never seen hold a gun in his life, takes aim and shoots the dog square in the head from an amazing distance. They're further shocked to discover that he is the deadest shot in Maycomb county, an accomplishment he's never bothered to mention to them since he doesn't like guns."
"When we were small, Jem and I confined our activities to the southern neighborhood, but when I was well into the second grade at school and tormenting Boo Radley became passe, the business section of Maycomb drew us frequently up the street past the real property of Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose. It was impossible to go to town without passing her house unless we wished to walk a mile out of the way. Previous minor encounters with her left me with no desire for more, but Jem said I had to grow up some time. Mrs. Dubose lived alone except for a Negro girl in constant attendance, two doors up the street from us in a house with steep front steps and a dog-trot hall. She was very old; she spent most of each day in bed and the rest of it in a wheelchair. It was rumored that she kept a CSA pistol concealed among her numerous shawls and wraps. Jem and I hated her. If she was on the porch when we passed, we would be raked by her wrathful gaze, subjected to ruthless interrogation regarding our behavior, and given a melancholy prediction on what we would amount to when we grew up, which was always nothing. We had long ago given up the idea of walking past her house on the opposite side of the street; that only made her raise her voice and let the whole neighborhood in on it. We could do nothing to please her. If I said as sunnily as I could, Hey, Mrs. Dubose, I would receive for an answer, Dont you say hey to me, you ugly girl! You say good afternoon, Mrs. Dubose! She was vicious. Once she heard Jem refer to our father as Atticus and her reaction was apoplectic. Besides being the sassiest, most disrespectful mutts who ever passed her way, we were told that it was quite a pity our father had not remarried after our mothers death. A lovelier lady than our mother never lived, she said, and it was heartbreaking the way Atticus Finch let her children run wild. I did not remember our mother, but Jem didhe would tell me about her sometimesand he went livid when Mrs. Dubose shot us this message. Jem, having survived Boo Radley, a mad dog and other terrors, had concluded that it was cowardly to stop at Miss Rachels front steps and wait, and had decreed that we must run as far as the post office corner each evening to meet Atticus coming from work. Countless evenings Atticus would find Jem furious at something Mrs. Dubose had said when we went by. Easy does it, son, Atticus would say. Shes an old lady and shes ill. You just hold your head high and be a gentleman. Whatever she says to you, its your job not to let her make you mad. Jem would say she must not be very sick, she hollered so. When the three of us came to her house, Atticus would sweep off his hat, wave gallantly to her and say, Good evening, Mrs. Dubose! You look like a picture thisevening. I never heard Atticus say like a picture of what. He would tell her the courthouse news, and would say he hoped with all his heart shed have a good day tomorrow. He would return his hat to his head, swing me to his shoulders in her very presence, and we would go home in the twilight. It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who everlived. The day after Jems twelfth birthday his money was burning up his pockets, so we headed for town in the early afternoon. Jem thought he had enough to buy a miniature steam engine for himself and a twirling baton for me. I had long had my eye on that baton: it was at V. J. Elmores, it was bedecked with sequins and tinsel, it cost seventeen cents. It was then my burning ambition to grow up and twirl with the Maycomb County High School band. Having developed my talent to where I could throw up a stick and almost catch it coming down, I had caused Calpurnia to deny me entrance to the house every time she saw me with a stick in my hand. I felt that I could overcome this defect with a real baton, and I thought it generous of Jem to buy one for me. Mrs. Dubose was stationed on her porch when we went by. Where are you two going at this time of day? she shouted. Playing hooky, I suppose. Ill just call up the principal and tell him! She put her hands on the wheels of her chair and executed a perfect right face. Aw, its Saturday, Mrs. Dubose, said Jem. Makes no difference if its Saturday, she said obscurely. I wonder if your father knows where you are? Mrs. Dubose, weve been goin to town by ourselves since we were this high. Jem placed his hand palm down about two feet above the sidewalk. Dont you lie to me! she yelled. Jeremy Finch, Maudie Atkinson told me you broke down her scuppernong arbor this morning. Shes going to tell your father and then youll wish you never saw the light of day! If you arent sent to the reform school before next week, my names not Dubose! Jem, who hadnt been near Miss Maudies scuppernong arbor since last summer, and who knew Miss Maudie wouldnt tell Atticus if he had, issued a general denial. Dont you contradict me! Mrs. Dubose bawled. And you she pointed an arthritic finger at mewhat are you doing in those overalls? You should be in a dress and camisole, young lady! Youll grow up waiting on tables if somebody doesnt change your waysa Finch waiting on tables at the O.K. Cafhah! I was terrified. The O.K. Caf was a dim organization on the north side of the square. I grabbed Jems hand but he shook me loose. Come on, Scout, he whispered. Dont pay any attention to her, just hold your head high and be a gentleman. But Mrs. Dubose held us: Not only a Finch waiting on tables but one in the courthouse lawing for niggers! Jem stiffened. Mrs. Duboses shot had gone home and she knew it: Yes indeed, what has this world come to when a Finch goes against his raising? Ill tell you! She put her hand to her mouth. When she drew it away, it trailed a long silver thread of saliva. Your fathers no better than the niggers and trash he works for! Jem was scarlet. I pulled at his sleeve, and we were followed up the sidewalk by a philippic on our familys moral degeneration, the major premise of which was that half the Finches were in the asylum anyway, but if our mother were living we would not have come to such a state. I wasnt sure what Jem resented most, but I took umbrage at Mrs. Duboses assessmentofthefamilysmentalhygiene.Ihadbecomealmostaccustomedtohearing insults aimed at Atticus. But this was the first one coming from an adult. Except for her remarks about Atticus, Mrs. Duboses attack was only routine. There was a hint of summer in the airin the shadows it was cool, but the sun was warm, which meant good times coming: no school andDill. Jem bought his steam engine and we went by Elmores for my baton. Jem took no pleasure in his acquisition; he jammed it in his pocket and walked silently beside me toward home. On the way home I nearly hit Mr. Link Deas, who said, Look out now, Scout! when I missed a toss, and when we approached Mrs. Duboses house my baton was grimy from having picked it up out of the dirt so many times. She was not on the porch. In later years, I sometimes wondered exactly what made Jem do it, what made him break the bonds of You just be a gentleman, son, and the phase of self-conscious rectitude he had recently entered. Jem had probably stood as much guff about Atticus lawing for niggers as had I, and I took it for granted that he kept his temperhe had a naturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse. At the time, however, I thought the only explanation for what he did was that for a few minutes he simply went mad. What Jem did was something Id do as a matter of course had I not been under Atticuss interdict, which I assumed included not fighting horrible old ladies. We had just come to her gate when Jem snatched my baton and ran flailing wildly up the steps into Mrs. Duboses front yard, forgetting everything Atticus had said, forgetting that she packed a pistol under her shawls, forgetting that if Mrs. Dubose missed, her girl Jessie probably wouldnt. He did not begin to calm down until he had cut the tops off every camellia bush Mrs. Dubose owned, until the ground was littered with green buds and leaves. He bent my baton against his knee, snapped it in two and threw it down. By that time I was shrieking. Jem yanked my hair, said he didnt care, hed do it again if he got a chance, and if I didnt shut up hed pull every hair out of my head. I didnt shut up and he kicked me. I lost my balance and fell on my face. Jem picked me up roughly but looked like he was sorry. There was nothing to say. We did not choose to meet Atticus coming home that evening. We skulked around the kitchen until Calpurnia threw us out. By some voo-doo system Calpurnia seemed to know all about it. She was a less than satisfactory source of palliation, but she did give Jem a hot biscuit-and-butter which he tore in half and shared with me. It tasted like cotton. We went to the livingroom. I picked up a football magazine, found a picture of Dixie Howell, showed it to Jem and said, This looks like you. That was the nicest thing I could think to say to him, but it was no help. He sat by the windows, hunched down in a rocking chair, scowling, waiting. Daylight faded. Two geological ages later, we heard the soles of Atticuss shoes scrape the front steps. The screen door slammed, there was a pauseAtticus was at the hat rack in the halland we heard him call, Jem! His voice was like the winter wind. Atticusswitchedontheceilinglightinthelivingroomandfoundusthere,frozenstill. Hecarriedmybatoninonehand;itsfilthyyellowtasseltrailedontherug.Heheldout his other hand; it contained fat camelliabuds. Jem, he said, are you responsible for this? Yes sir. Whyd you do it? Jem said softly, She said you lawed for niggers and trash. You did this because she said that? Jems lips moved, but his, Yes sir, was inaudible. Son, I have no doubt that youve been annoyed by your contemporaries about me lawing for niggers, as you say, but to do something like this to a sick old lady is inexcusable. I strongly advise you to go down and have a talk with Mrs. Dubose, said Atticus. Come straight home afterward. Jem did not move. Go on, I said. I followed Jem out of the livingroom. Come back here, Atticus said to me. I came back. Atticus picked up theMobile Pressand sat down in the rocking chair Jem had vacated. For the life of me, I did not understand how he could sit there in cold blood and read a newspaper when his only son stood an excellent chance of being murdered with a Confederate Army relic. Of course Jem antagonized me sometimes until I could kill him, but when it came down to it he was all I had. Atticus did not seem to realize this, or if he did he didnt care. I hated him for that, but when you are in trouble you become easily tired: soon I was hiding in his lap and his arms were around me. Youre mighty big to be rocked, he said. You dont care what happens to him, I said. You just send him on to get shot at when all he was doin was standin up for you. Atticus pushed my head under his chin. Its not time to worry yet, he said. I never thought Jemd be the one to lose his head over thisthought Id have more trouble with you. I said I didnt see why we had to keep our heads anyway, that nobody I knew at school had to keep his head about anything. Scout, said Atticus, when summer comes youll have to keep your head about far worse things its not fair for you and Jem, I know that, but sometimes we have to make the best of things, and the way we conduct ourselves when the chips are down well, all I can say is, when you and Jem are grown, maybe youll look back on this with some compassion and some feeling that I didnt let you down. This case, Tom Robinsons case, is something that goes to the essence of a mans conscienceScout, I couldnt go to church and worship God if I didnt try to help that man. Atticus, you must be wrong Hows that? Well, most folks seem to think theyre right and youre wrong Theyre certainly entitled to think that, and theyre entitled to full respect for their opinions, said Atticus, but before I can live with other folks Ive got to live with myself. The one thing that doesnt abide by majority rule is a persons conscience. When Jem returned, he found me still in Atticuss lap, Well, son? said Atticus. He set me on my feet, and I made a secret reconnaissance of Jem. He seemed to be all in one piece, but he had a queer look on his face. Perhaps she had given him a dose of calomel. I cleaned it up for her and said I was sorry, but I aint, and that Id work on em ever Saturday and try to make em grow back out. There was no point in saying you were sorry if you arent, said Atticus. Jem, shes old and ill. You cant hold her responsible for what she says and does. Of course, Id rather shed have said it to me than to either of you, but we cant always have our druthers. Jem seemed fascinated by a rose in the carpet. Atticus, he said, she wants me to read to her. Read to her? Yes sir. She wants me to come every afternoon after school and Saturdays and read to her out loud for two hours. Atticus, do I have to? Certainly. But she wants me to do it for a month. Then youll do it for a month. Jem planted his big toe delicately in the center of the rose and pressed it in. Finally he said, Atticus, its all right on the sidewalk but inside itsits all dark and creepy. Theres shadows and things on the ceiling Atticus smiled grimly. That should appeal to your imagination. Just pretend youre inside the Radley house. The following Monday afternoon Jem and I climbed the steep front steps to Mrs. Duboses house and padded down the open hallway. Jem, armed withIvanhoeand full of superior knowledge, knocked at the second door on the left. Mrs. Dubose? he called. Jessie opened the wood door and unlatched the screen door. Is that you, Jem Finch? she said. You got your sister with you. I dont know Let em both in, Jessie, said Mrs. Dubose. Jessie admitted us and went off to the kitchen. An oppressive odor met us when we crossed the threshold, an odor I had met many times in rain-rotted gray houses where there are coal-oil lamps, water dippers, and unbleached domestic sheets. It always made me afraid, expectant, watchful. In the corner of the room was a brass bed, and in the bed was Mrs. Dubose. I wondered if Jems activities had put her there, and for a moment I felt sorry for her. She was lying under a pile of quilts and looked almost friendly. There was a marble-topped washstand by her bed; on it were a glass with a teaspoon in it, a red ear syringe, a box of absorbent cotton, and a steel alarm clock standing on three tiny legs. So you brought that dirty little sister of yours, did you? was her greeting. Jem said quietly, My sister aint dirty and I aint scared of you, although I noticed his knees shaking. I was expecting a tirade, but all she said was, You may commence reading, Jeremy. Jem sat down in a cane-bottom chair and openedIvanhoe. I pulled up another one and sat beside him. Come closer, said Mrs. Dubose. Come to the side of the bed. We moved our chairs forward. This was the nearest I had ever been to her, and the thing I wanted most to do was move my chair back again. She was horrible. Her face was the color of a dirty pillowcase, and the corners of her mouth glistened with wet, which inched like a glacier down the deep grooves enclosing her chin. Old-age liver spots dotted her cheeks, and her pale eyes had black pinpoint pupils. Her hands were knobby, and the cuticles were grown up over her fingernails. Her bottom plate was not in, and her upper lip protruded; from time to time she would draw her nether lip to her upper plate and carry her chin with it. This made the wet move faster. I didnt look any more than I had to. Jem reopenedIvanhoeand began reading. I tried to keep up with him, but he read too fast. When Jem came to a word he didnt know, he skipped it, but Mrs. Dubose would catch him and make him spell it out. Jem read for perhaps twenty minutes, during which time I looked at the soot-stained mantelpiece, out the window, anywhere to keep from looking at her. As he read along, I noticed that Mrs. Duboses correcti
ns grew fewer and farther between, that Jem had even left one sentence dangling in mid-air. She was not listening. I looked toward the bed. Something had happened to her. She lay on her back, with the quilts up to her chin. Only her head and shoulders were visible. Her head moved slowly from side to side. From time to time she would open her mouth wide, and I could see her tongue undulate faintly. Cords of saliva would collect on her lips; she would draw them in, then open her mouth again. Her mouth seemed to have a private existence of its own. It worked separate and apart from the rest of her, out and in, like a clam hole at low tide. Occasionally it would say, Pt, like some viscous substance coming to a boil. I pulled Jems sleeve. He looked at me, then at the bed. Her head made its regular sweep toward us, and Jem said, Mrs. Dubose, are you all right? She did not hear him. The alarm clock went off and scared us stiff. A minute later, nerves still tingling, Jem and I were on the sidewalk headed for home. We did not run away, Jessie sent us: before the clock wound down she was in the room pushing Jem and me out of it. Shoo, she said, you all go home. Jem hesitated at the door. Its time for her medicine, Jessie said. As the door swung shut behind us I saw Jessie walking quickly toward Mrs. Duboses bed. It was only three forty-five when we got home, so Jem and I drop-kicked in the back yard until it was time to meet Atticus. Atticus had two yellow pencils for me and a football magazine for Jem, which I suppose was a silent reward for our first days session with Mrs. Dubose. Jem told him what happened. Did she frighten you? asked Atticus. No sir, said Jem, but shes so nasty. She has fits or somethin. She spits a lot. She cant help that. When people are sick they dont look nice sometimes. She scared me, Isaid. Atticus looked at me over his glasses. You dont have to go with Jem, you know. The next afternoon at Mrs. Duboses was the same as the first, and so was the next, until gradually a pattern emerged: everything would begin normallythat is, Mrs. Dubose would hound Jem for a while on her favorite subjects, her camellias and our fathers nigger-loving propensities; she would grow increasingly silent, then go away from us. The alarm clock would ring, Jessie would shoo us out, and the rest of the day was ours. Atticus, I said one evening, what exactly is a nigger-lover? Atticuss face was grave. Has somebody been calling you that? No sir, Mrs. Dubose calls you that. She warms up every afternoon calling you that. Francis called me that last Christmas, thats where I first heard it. Is that the reason you jumped on him? asked Atticus. Yes sir Then why are you asking me what it means? I tried to explain to Atticus that it wasnt so much what Francis said that had infuriated me as the way he had said it. It was like hed said snot-nose or somethin. Scout, said Atticus, nigger-lover is just one of those terms that dont mean anythinglike snot-nose. Its hard to explainignorant, trashy people use it when they think somebodys favoring Negroes over and above themselves. Its slipped into usage with some people like ourselves, when they want a common, ugly term to label somebody. You arent really a nigger-lover, then, are you? I certainly am. I do my best to love everybody Im hard put, sometimesbaby, its never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name. It just shows you how poor that person is, it doesnt hurt you. So dont let Mrs. Dubose get you down. She has enough troubles of her own. One afternoon a month later Jem was ploughing his way through Sir Walter Scout, as Jem called him, and Mrs. Dubose was correcting him at every turn, when there was a knock on the door. Come in! she screamed. Atticus came in. He went to the bed and took Mrs. Duboses hand. I was coming from the office and didnt see the children, he said. I thought they might still be here. Mrs. Dubose smiled at him. For the life of me I could not figure out how she could bring herself to speak to him when she seemed to hate him so. Do you know what time it is, Atticus? she said. Exactly fourteen minutes past five. The alarm clocks set for five-thirty. I want you to know that. It suddenly came to me that each day we had been staying a little longer at Mrs. Duboses, that the alarm clock went off a few minutes later every day, and that she was well into one of her fits by the time it sounded. Today she had antagonized Jem for nearly two hours with no intention of having a fit, and I felt hopelessly trapped. The alarm clock was the signal for our release; if one day it did not ring, what would we do? I have a feeling that Jems reading days are numbered, said Atticus. Only a week longer, I think, she said, just to make sure Jem rose. But Atticus put out his hand and Jem was silent. On the way home, Jem said he had to do it just for a month and the month was up and it wasnt fair. Just one more week, son, said Atticus. No, said Jem. Yes, said Atticus. The following week found us back at Mrs. Duboses. The alarm clock had ceased sounding, but Mrs. Dubose would release us with, Thatll do, so late in the afternoon Atticus would be home reading the paper when we returned. Although her fits had passed off, she was in every other way her old self: when Sir Walter Scott became involved in lengthy descriptions of moats and castles, Mrs. Dubose would become bored and pick on us: Jeremy Finch, I told you youd live to regret tearing up my camellias. You regret it now, dont you? Jem would say he certainly did. Thought you could kill my Snow-on-the-Mountain, did you? Well, Jessie says the tops growing back out. Next time youll know how to do it right, wont you? Youll pull it up by the roots, wont you? Jem would say he certainly would. Dont you mutter at me, boy! You hold up your head and say yes maam. Dont guess you feel like holding it up, though, with your father what he is. Jems chin would come up, and he would gaze at Mrs. Dubose with a face devoid of resentment. Through the weeks he had cultivated an expression of polite and detached interest, which he would present to her in answer to her most blood-curdling inventions. At last the day came. When Mrs. Dubose said, Thatll do, one afternoon, she added, And thats all. Good-day to you. It was over. We bounded down the sidewalk on a spree of sheer relief, leaping and howling. Thatspringwasagoodone:thedaysgrewlongerandgaveusmoreplayingtime. Jemsmindwasoccupiedmostlywiththevitalstatisticsofeverycollegefootballplayer in the nation. Every night Atticus would read us the sports pages of thenewspapers. Alabama might go to the Rose Bowl again this year, judging from its prospects, not one of whose names we could pronounce. Atticus was in the middle of Windy Seatons column one evening when the telephone rang. He answered it, then went to the hat rack in the hall. Im going down to Mrs. Duboses for a while, he said. I wont be long. But Atticus stayed away until long past my bedtime. When he returned he was carrying a candy box. Atticus sat down in the livingroom and put the box on the floor beside his chair. Whatd she want? asked Jem. We had not seen Mrs. Dubose for over a month. She was never on the porch any more when we passed. Shes dead, son, said Atticus. She died a few minutes ago. Oh, said Jem. Well. Well is right, said Atticus. Shes not suffering any more. She was sick for a long time. Son, didnt you know what her fits were? Jem shook his head. Mrs. Dubose was a morphine addict, said Atticus. She took it as a pain-killer for years. The doctor put her on it. Shed have spent the rest of her life on it and died without so much agony, but she was too contrary Sir? said Jem. Atticus said, Just before your escapade she called me to make her will. Dr. Reynolds told her she had only a few months left. Her business affairs were in perfect order but she said, Theres still one thing out of order. What was that? Jem was perplexed. She said she was going to leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody. Jem, when youre sick as she was, its all right to take anything to make it easier, but it wasnt all right for her. She said she meant to break herself of it before she died, and thats what she did. Jem said, You mean thats what her fits were? Yes, thats what they were. Most of the time you were reading to her I doubt if she heard a word you said. Her whole mind and body were concentrated on that alarm clock. If you hadnt fallen into her hands, Id have made you go read to her anyway. It may have been some distraction. There was another reason Did she die free? asked Jem. As the mountain air, said Atticus. She was conscious to the last, almost. Conscious, he smiled, and cantankerous. She still disapproved heartily of my doings, and said Id probably spend the rest of my life bailing you out of jail. She had Jessie fix you this box Atticus reached down and picked up the candy box. He handed it to Jem. Jem opened the box. Inside, surrounded by wads of damp cotton, was a white, waxy, perfect camellia. It was aSnow-on-the-Mountain. Jemseyesnearlypoppedoutofhishead.Oldhell-devil,oldhell-devil!hescreamed, flinging it down. Why cant she leave mealone? In a flash Atticus was up and standing over him. Jem buried his face in Atticuss shirt front. Sh-h, he said. I think that was her way of telling youeverythings all right now, Jem, everythings all right. You know, she was a great lady. A lady? Jem raised his head. His face was scarlet. After all those things she said about you, a lady? She was. She had her own views about things, a lot different from mine, maybe son, I told you that if you hadnt lost your head Id have made you go read to her. I wanted you to see something about herI wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. Its when you know youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won, all ninety-eight pounds of her. According to her views, she died beholden to nothing and nobody. She was the bravest person I ever knew. Jem picked up the candy box and threw it in the fire. He picked up the camellia, and when I went off to bed I saw him fingering the wide petals. Atticus was reading the paper.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch11,"The day after Jem's 12th birthday finds the two walking into town to spend his birthday money. The downside to taking the route into town is that they have to walk past Mrs. Dubose's house, a cantankerous, bitter old woman who lives at the end of the street. She never has anything good to say to anyone, but Atticus constantly tells the two of them to ignore her foul words and treat her with courtesy and respect. Normally they're able to do this, but today their patience is pushed thin when she starts insulting Atticus's decision to defend Tom Robinson. They wait until they're on their way back home from town and suddenly Jem starts destroying Mrs. Dubose's flowers with Scout's baton wand, chopping them viciously off the bush and scattering them across her yard. When Atticus comes home later that evening, he knows he's in for it worse than he's ever been. Atticus makes Jem go to her house and talk with her, and when Jem returns he says that she is making him read to her everyday for the next month. When Monday comes around, Scout goes with him to keep him company, and the days drag by. When she dies a month later, Atticus informs them that Mrs. Dubose was a morphine addict who had decided she was not going to die addicted to the drug. Jem's afternoons of reading to her broke her from her addiction, and she was able to die in peace."
"Jem was twelve. He was difficult to live with, inconsistent, moody. His appetite was appalling, and he told me so many times to stop pestering him I consulted Atticus: Reckon hes got a tapeworm? Atticus said no, Jem was growing. I must be patient with him and disturb him as little as possible. This change in Jem had come about in a matter of weeks. Mrs. Dubose was not cold in her graveJem had seemed grateful enough for my company when he went to read to her. Overnight, it seemed, Jem had acquired an alien set of values and was trying to impose them on me: several times he went so far as to tell me what to do. After one altercation when Jem hollered, Its time you started bein a girl and acting right! I burst into tears and fled to Calpurnia. Dont you fret too much over Mister Jem she began. Mister Jem? Yeah, hes just about Mister Jem now. He aint that old, I said. All he needs is somebody to beat him up, and I aint big enough. Baby, said Calpurnia, I just cant help it if Mister Jems growin up. Hes gonna want to be off to himself a lot now, doin whatever boys do, so you just come right on in the kitchen when you feel lonesome. Well find lots of things to do in here. The beginning of that summer boded well: Jem could do as he pleased; Calpurnia would do until Dill came. She seemed glad to see me when I appeared in the kitchen, and by watching her I began to think there was some skill involved in being a girl. But summer came and Dill was not there. I received a letter and a snapshot from him. The letter said he had a new father whose picture was enclosed, and he would have to stay in Meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat. His father was a lawyer like Atticus, only much younger. Dills new father had a pleasant face, which made me glad Dill had captured him, but I was crushed. Dill concluded by saying he would love me forever and not to worry, he would come get me and marry me as soon as he got enough money together, so please write. The fact that I had a permanent fianc was little compensation for his absence: I had never thought about it, but summer was Dill by the fishpool smoking string, Dills eyes alive with complicated plans to make Boo Radley emerge; summer was the swiftness with which Dill would reach up and kiss me when Jem was not looking, the longings we sometimes felt each other feel. With him, life was routine; without him, life was unbearable. I stayed miserable for two days. As if that were not enough, the state legislature was called into emergency session and Atticus left us for two weeks. The Governor was eager to scrape a few barnacles off the ship of state; there were sit-down strikes in Birmingham; bread lines in the cities grew longer, people in the country grew poorer. But these were events remote from the world of Jem and me. We were surprised one morning to see a cartoon in theMontgomery Advertiserabove the caption, Maycombs Finch. It showed Atticus barefooted and in short pants, chained to a desk: he was diligently writing on a slate while some frivolous-looking girls yelled, Yoo-hoo! at him. Thats a compliment, explained Jem. He spends his time doin things that wouldnt get done if nobody did em. Huh? In addition to Jems newly developed characteristics, he had acquired a maddening air of wisdom. Oh, Scout, its like reorganizing the tax systems of the counties and things. That kind of things pretty dry to most men. How do you know? Oh, go on and leave me alone. Im readin the paper. Jem got his wish. I departed for the kitchen. While she was shelling peas, Calpurnia suddenly said, What am I gonna do about you alls church this Sunday? Nothing, I reckon. Atticus left us collection. Calpurnias eyes narrowed and I could tell what was going through her mind. Cal, I said, you know well behave. We havent done anything in church in years. Calpurnia evidently remembered a rainy Sunday when we were both fatherless and teacherless. Left to its own devices, the class tied Eunice Ann Simpson to a chair and placed her in the furnace room. We forgot her, trooped upstairs to church, and were listening quietly to the sermon when a dreadful banging issued from the radiator pipes, persisting until someone investigated and brought forth Eunice Ann saying she didnt want to play Shadrach any moreJem Finch said she wouldnt get burnt if she had enough faith, but it was hot down there. Besides, Cal, this isnt the first time Atticus has left us, I protested. Yeah, but he makes certain your teachers gonna be there. I didnt hear him say this timereckon he forgot it. Calpurnia scratched her head. Suddenly she smiled. Howd you and Mister Jem like to come to church with me tomorrow? Really? How bout it? grinned Calpurnia. If Calpurnia had ever bathed me roughly before, it was nothing compared to her supervision of that Saturday nights routine. She made me soap all over twice, drew fresh water in the tub for each rinse; she stuck my head in the basin and washed it with Octagon soap and castile. She had trusted Jem for years, but that night she invaded his privacy and provoked an outburst: Cant anybody take a bath in this house without the whole family lookin? Next morning she began earlier than usual, to go over our clothes. When Calpurnia stayed overnight with us she slept on a folding cot in the kitchen; that morning it was covered with our Sunday habiliments. She had put so much starch in my dress it came up like a tent when I sat down. She made me wear a petticoat and she wrapped a pink sash tightly around my waist. She went over my patent-leather shoes with a cold biscuit until she saw her face in them. Its like we were goin to Mardi Gras, said Jem. Whats all this for, Cal? I dont want anybody sayin I dont look after my children, she muttered. Mister Jem, you absolutely cant wear that tie with that suit. Its green. Smatter with that? Suits blue. Cant you tell? Hee hee, I howled, Jems color blind. His face flushed angrily, but Calpurnia said, Now you all quit that. Youre gonna go to First Purchase with smiles on your faces. First Purchase African M.E. Church was in the Quarters outside the southern town limits, across the old sawmill tracks. It was an ancient paint-peeled frame building, the only church in Maycomb with a steeple and bell, called First Purchase because it was paid for from the first earnings of freed slaves. Negroes worshiped in it on Sundays and white men gambled in it on weekdays. The churchyard was brick-hard clay, as was the cemetery beside it. If someone died during a dry spell, the body was covered with chunks of ice until rain softened the earth. A few graves in the cemetery were marked with crumbling tombstones; newer ones were outlined with brightly colored glass and broken Coca-Cola bottles. Lightning rods guarding some graves denoted dead who rested uneasily; stumps of burned-out candles stood at the heads of infant graves. It was a happy cemetery. The warm bittersweet smell of clean Negro welcomed us as we entered the churchyardHearts of Love hairdressing mingled with asafoetida, snuff, Hoyts Cologne, Browns Mule, peppermint, and lilac talcum. When they saw Jem and me with Calpurnia, the men stepped back and took off their hats; the women crossed their arms at their waists, weekday gestures of respectful attention. They parted and made a small pathway to the church door for us. Calpurnia walked between Jem and me, responding to the greetings of her brightly clad neighbors. What you up to, Miss Cal? said a voice behind us. Calpurnias hands went to our shoulders and we stopped and looked around: standing in the path behind us was a tall Negro woman. Her weight was on one leg; she rested her left elbow in the curve of her hip, pointing at us with upturned palm. She was bullet- headed with strange almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and an Indian-bow mouth. She seemed seven feet high. I felt Calpurnias hand dig into my shoulder. What you want, Lula? she asked, in tones I had never heard her use. She spoke quietly, contemptuously. I wants to know why you bringin white chillun to nigger church. Theys my compny, said Calpurnia. Again I thought her voice strange: she was talking like the rest of them. Yeah, an I reckon yous compny at the Finch house durin the week. A murmur ran through the crowd. Dont you fret, Calpurnia whispered to me, but the roses on her hat trembled indignantly. When Lula came up the pathway toward us Calpurnia said, Stop right there, nigger. Lula stopped, but she said, You aint got no business bringin white chillun herethey got their church, we got ourn. It is our church, aint it, Miss Cal? Calpurnia said, Its the same God, aint it? Jem said, Lets go home, Cal, they dont want us here I agreed: they did not want us here. I sensed, rather than saw, that we were being advanced upon. They seemed to be drawing closer to us, but when I looked up at Calpurnia there was amusement in her eyes. When I looked down the pathway again, Lula was gone. In her place was a solid mass of colored people. One of them stepped from the crowd. It was Zeebo, the garbage collector. Mister Jem, he said, were mighty glad to have you all here. Dont pay no tention to Lula, shes contentious because Reverend Sykes threatened to church her. Shes a troublemaker from way back, got fancy ideas an haughty wayswere mighty glad to have you all. With that, Calpurnia led us to the church door where we were greeted by Reverend Sykes, who led us to the front pew. First Purchase was unceiled and unpainted within. Along its walls unlighted kerosene lamps hung on brass brackets; pine benches served as pews. Behind the rough oak pulpit a faded pink silk banner proclaimed God Is Love, the churchs only decoration except a rotogravure print of HuntsThe Light of the World. There was no sign of piano, organ, hymn-books, church programsthe familiar ecclesiastical impedimenta we saw every Sunday. It was dim inside, with a damp coolness slowly dispelled by the gathering congregation. At each seat was a cheap cardboard fan bearing a garish Garden of Gethsemane, courtesy Tyndals Hardware Co. (You-Name-It-We-Sell-It). Calpurnia motioned Jem and me to the end of the row and placed herself between us. She fished in her purse, drew out her handkerchief, and untied the hard wad of change in its corner. She gave a dime to me and a dime to Jem. Weve got ours, he whispered. You keep it, Calpurnia said, youre my company. Jems face showed brief indecision on the ethics of withholding his own dime, but his innate courtesy won and he shifted his dime to his pocket. I did likewise with noqualms. Cal, I whispered, where are the hymn-books? We dont have any, she said. Well how? Sh-h, she said. Reverend Sykes was standing behind the pulpit staring the congregation to silence. He was a short, stocky man in a black suit, black tie, white shirt, and a gold watch-chain that glinted in the light from the frosted windows. He said, Brethren and sisters, we are particularly glad to have company with us this morning. Mister and Miss Finch. You all know their father. Before I begin I will read some announcements. Reverend Sykes shuffled some papers, chose one and held it at arms length. The Missionary Society meets in the home of Sister Annette Reeves next Tuesday. Bring your sewing. He read from another paper. You all know of Brother Tom Robinsons trouble. He has been a faithful member of First Purchase since he was a boy. The collection taken up today and for the next three Sundays will go to Helenhis wife, to help her out at home. I punched Jem. Thats the Tom Atticuss de Sh-h! I turned to Calpurnia but was hushed before I opened my mouth. Subdued, I fixed my attention upon Reverend Sykes, who seemed to be waiting for me to settle down. Will the music superintendent lead us in the first hymn, he said. Zeebo rose from his pew and walked down the center aisle, stopping in front of us and facing the congregation. He was carrying a battered hymn-book. He opened it and said, Well sing number two seventy-three. This was too much for me. Howre we gonna sing it if there aint any hymn-books? Calpurnia smiled. Hush baby, she whispered, youll see in a minute. Zeebo cleared his throat and read in a voice like the rumble of distant artillery: Theres a land beyond the river. Miraculously on pitch, a hundred voices sang out Zeebos words. The last syllable, held to a husky hum, was followed by Zeebo saying, That we call the sweet forever. Music again swelled around us; the last note lingered and Zeebo met it with the next line: And we only reach that shore by faiths decree. The congregation hesitated, Zeebo repeated the line carefully, and it was sung. At the chorus Zeebo closed the book, a signal for the congregation to proceed without his help. On the dying notes of Jubilee, Zeebo said, In that far-off sweet forever, just beyond the shining river. Line for line, voices followed in simple harmony until the hymn ended in a melancholy murmur. I looked at Jem, who was looking at Zeebo from the corners of his eyes. I didnt believe it either, but we had both heard it. Reverend Sykes then called on the Lord to bless the sick and the suffering, a procedure no different from our church practice, except Reverend Sykes directed the Deitys attention to several specific cases. His sermon was a forthright denunciation of sin, an austere declaration of the motto on the wall behind him: he warned his flock against the evils of heady brews, gambling, and strange women. Bootleggers caused enough trouble in the Quarters, but women were worse. Again, as I had often met it in my own church, I was confronted with the Impurity of Women doctrine that seemed to preoccupy all clergymen. Jem and I had heard the same sermon Sunday after Sunday, with only one exception. Reverend Sykes used his pulpit more freely to express his views on individual lapses from grace: Jim Hardy had been absent from church for five Sundays and he wasnt sick; Constance Jackson had better watch her waysshe was in grave danger for quarreling with her neighbors; she had erected the only spite fence in the history of the Quarters. Reverend Sykes closed his sermon. He stood beside a table in front of the pulpit and requested the morning offering, a proceeding that was strange to Jem and me. One by one, the congregation came forward and dropped nickels and dimes into a black enameled coffee can. Jem and I followed suit, and received a soft, Thank you, thank you, as our dimes clinked. To our amazement, Reverend Sykes emptied the can onto the table and raked the coins into his hand. He straightened up and said, This is not enough, we must have ten dollars. The congregation stirred. You all know what its forHelen cant leave those children to work while Toms in jail. If everybody gives one more dime, well have it Reverend Sykes waved his hand and called to someone in the back of the church. Alec, shut the doors. Nobody leaves here till we have ten dollars. Calpurnia scratched in her handbag and brought forth a battered leather coin purse. Naw Cal, Jem whispered, when she handed him a shiny quarter, we can put ours in. Gimme your dime, Scout. Thechurchwasbecomingstuffy,anditoccurredtomethatReverendSykesintended to sweat the amount due out of his flock. Fans crackled, feet shuffled, tobacco-chewers were in agony. Reverend Sykes startled me by saying sternly, Carlow Richardson, I havent seen you up this aisle yet. A thin man in khaki pants came up the aisle and deposited a coin. The congregation murmured approval. Reverend Sykes then said, I want all of you with no children to make a sacrifice and give one more dime apiece. Then well have it. Slowly, painfully, the ten dollars was collected. The door was opened, and the gust of warm air revived us. Zeebo lined OnJordans Stormy Banks, and church was over. I wanted to stay and explore, but Calpurnia propelled me up the aisle ahead of her. At the church door, while she paused to talk with Zeebo and his family, Jem and I chatted with Reverend Sykes. I was bursting with questions, but decided I would wait and let Calpurnia answer them. 
We were specially glad to have you all here, said Reverend Sykes. This church has no better friend than your daddy. My curiosity burst: Why were you all takin up collection for Tom Robinsons wife? Didnt you hear why? asked Reverend Sykes. Helens got three littleuns and she cant go out to work Why cant she take em with her, Reverend? I asked. It was customary for field Negroes with tiny children to deposit them in whatever shade there was while their parents workedusually the babies sat in the shade between two rows of cotton. Those unable to sit were strapped papoose-style on their mothers backs, or resided in extra cotton bags. Reverend Sykes hesitated. To tell you the truth, Miss Jean Louise, Helens finding it hard to get work these days when its picking time, I think Mr. Link Deasll take her. Why not, Reverend? Before he could answer, I felt Calpurnias hand on my shoulder. At its pressure I said, We thank you for lettin us come. Jem echoed me, and we made our way homeward. Cal, I know Tom Robinsons in jail an hes done somethin awful, but why wont folks hire Helen? I asked. Calpurnia, in her navy voile dress and tub of a hat, walked between Jem and me. Its because of what folks say Toms done, she said. Folks arent anxious toto have anything to do with any of his family. Just what did he do, Cal? Calpurnia sighed. Old Mr. Bob Ewell accused him of rapin his girl an had him arrested an put in jail Mr. Ewell? My memory stirred. Does he have anything to do with those Ewells that come every first day of school an then go home? Why, Atticus said they were absolute trashI never heard Atticus talk about folks the way he talked about the Ewells. He said- Yeah, those are the ones. Well, if everybody in Maycomb knows what kind of folks the Ewells are theyd be glad to hire Helen whats rape, Cal? Its somethin youll have to ask Mr. Finch about, she said. He can explain it better than I can. You all hungry? The Reverend took a long time unwindin this morning, hes not usually so tedious. Hes just like our preacher, said Jem, but why do you all sing hymns that way? Linin? she asked. Is that what it is? Yeah, its called linin. Theyve done it that way as long as I can remember. Jem said it looked like they could save the collection money for a year and get some hymn-books. Calpurnia laughed. Wouldnt do any good, she said. They cant read. Cant read? I asked. All those folks? Thats right, Calpurnia nodded. Cant but about four folks in First Purchase read Im one of em. Whered you go to school, Cal? asked Jem. Nowhere. Lets see now, who taught me my letters? It was Miss Maudie Atkinsons aunt, old Miss Buford Are youthatold? Im older than Mr. Finch, even. Calpurnia grinned. Not sure how much, though. We started rememberin one time, trying to figure out how old I wasI can remember back just a few years moren he can, so Im not much older, when you take off the fact that men cant remember as well as women. Whats your birthday, Cal? I just have it on Christmas, its easier to remember that wayI dont have a real birthday. But Cal, Jem protested, you dont look even near as old as Atticus. Colored folks dont show their ages so fast, she said. Maybe because they cant read. Cal, did you teach Zeebo? Yeah, Mister Jem. There wasnt a school even when he was a boy. I made him learn, though. Zeebo was Calpurnias eldest son. If I had ever thought about it, I would have known that Calpurnia was of mature yearsZeebo had half-grown childrenbut then I had never thought about it. Did you teach him out of a primer, like us? I asked. No, I made him get a page of the Bible every day, and there was a book Miss Buford taught me out ofbet you dont know where I got it, she said. We didnt know. Calpurnia said, Your Granddaddy Finch gave it to me. Were you from the Landing? Jem asked. You never told us that. I certainly am, Mister Jem. Grew up down there between the Buford Place and the Landin. Ive spent all my days workin for the Finches or the Bufords, an I moved to Maycomb when your daddy and your mamma married. What was the book, Cal? I asked. BlackstonesCommentaries. Jem was thunderstruck. You mean you taught Zeebo outathat? Why yes sir, Mister Jem. Calpurnia timidly put her fingers to her mouth. They were the only books I had. Your grandaddy said Mr. Blackstone wrote fine English Thats why you dont talk like the rest of em, said Jem. The rest of who? Rest of the colored folks. Cal, but you talked like they did in church That Calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me. The idea that she had a separate existence outside our household was a novel one, to say nothing of her having command of two languages. Cal, I asked, why do you talk nigger-talk to theto your folks when you know its not right? Well, in the first place Im black That doesnt mean you hafta talk that way when you know better, said Jem. Calpurnia tilted her hat and scratched her head, then pressed her hat down carefully over her ears. Its right hard to say, she said. Suppose you and Scout talked colored- folks talk at home itd be out of place, wouldnt it? Now what if I talked white-folks talk at church, and with my neighbors? Theyd think I was puttin on airs to beat Moses. But Cal, you know better, I said. Its not necessary to tell all you know. Its not ladylikein the second place, folks dont like to have somebody around knowin more than they do. It aggravates em. Youre not gonna change any of them by talkin right, theyve got to want to learn themselves,andwhentheydontwanttolearntheresnothingyoucandobutkeepyour mouth shut or talk theirlanguage. Cal, can I come to see you sometimes? She looked down at me. See me, honey? You see me every day. Out to your house, I said. Sometimes after work? Atticus can get me. Any time you want to, she said. Wed be glad to have you. We were on the sidewalk by the Radley Place. Look on the porch yonder, Jem said. I looked over to the Radley Place, expecting to see its phantom occupant sunning himself in the swing. The swing was empty. I mean our porch, said Jem. I looked down the street. Enarmored, upright, uncompromising, Aunt Alexandra was sitting in a rocking chair exactly as if she had sat there every day of her life.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch12,"As summer begins Scout is crushed to discover that Dill will not be joining them. When Atticus has to go out of town for two weeks, Calpurnia decides that she will take them to church with her. Aside from one woman, Jem and Scout are welcomed into the African church with open arms and they're amazed to see how different it is from their own staid church service. They're also amazed to find out that the church collection is going to Helen Robinson, Tom's wife, and the Reverend is not letting anyone leave until they've collected $10, which is what she needs each week to support her kids. Purses are scraped and pockets searched, and finally everyone comes up with enough money and the doors are opened. They also find out that Tom is in jail because he's accused of raping Bob Ewell's daughter, Mayella (who is white), which is why the entire town is in an uproar over Atticus taking on the case. When they get back home from church, they find Aunt Alexandra on the front porch swing waiting for them."
"Put my bag in the front bedroom, Calpurnia, was the first thing Aunt Alexandra said. Jean Louise, stop scratching your head, was the second thing she said. Calpurnia picked up Auntys heavy suitcase and opened the door. Ill take it, said Jem, and took it. I heard the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump. The sound had a dull permanence about it. Have you come for a visit, Aunty? I asked. Aunt Alexandras visits from the Landing were rare, and she traveled in state. She owned a bright green square Buick and a black chauffeur, both kept in an unhealthy state of tidiness, but today they were nowhere to be seen. Didnt your father tell you? she asked. Jem and I shook our heads. Probably he forgot. Hes not in yet, is he? Nome, he doesnt usually get back till late afternoon, said Jem. Well, your father and I decided it was time I came to stay with you for a while. For a while in Maycomb meant anything from three days to thirty years. Jem andI exchanged glances. Jems growing up now and you are too, she said to me. We decided that it would be best for you to have some feminine influence. It wont be many years, Jean Louise, before you become interested in clothes and boys I could have made several answers to this: Cals a girl, it would be many years before I would be interested in boys, I would never be interested in clothes but I kept quiet. What about Uncle Jimmy? asked Jem. Is he comin, too? Oh no, hes staying at the Landing. Hell keep the place going. The moment I said, Wont you miss him? I realized that this was not a tactful question. Uncle Jimmy present or Uncle Jimmy absent made not much difference, he never said anything. Aunt Alexandra ignored my question. I could think of nothing else to say to her. In fact I could never think of anything to say to her, and I sat thinking of past painful conversations between us: How are you, Jean Louise? Fine, thank you maam, how are you? Very well, thank you, what have you been doing with yourself? Nothin. Dont you do anything? Nome. Certainly you have friends? Yessum. Well what do you all do? Nothin. It was plain that Aunty thought me dull in the extreme, because I once heard her tell Atticus that I was sluggish. There was a story behind all this, but I had no desire to extract it from her then. Today was Sunday, and Aunt Alexandra was positively irritable on the Lords Day. I guess it was her Sunday corset. She was not fat, but solid, and she chose protective garments that drew up her bosom to giddy heights, pinched in her waist, flared out her rear, and managed to suggest that Aunt Alexandras was once an hour-glass figure. From any angle, it was formidable. The remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that descends when relatives appear, but was dispelled when we heard a car turn in the driveway. It was Atticus, home from Montgomery. Jem, forgetting his dignity, ran with me to meet him. Jem seized his briefcase and bag, I jumped into his arms, felt his vague dry kiss and said, d you bring me a book? d you know Auntys here? Atticus answered both questions in the affirmative. Howd you like for her to come live with us? I said I would like it very much, which was a lie, but one must lie under certain circumstances and at all times when one cant do anything about them. We felt it was time you children neededwell, its like this, Scout, Atticus said. Your aunts doing me a favor as well as you all. I cant stay here all day with you, and the summers going to be a hot one. Yes sir, I said, not understanding a word he said. I had an idea, however, that Aunt Alexandras appearance on the scene was not so much Atticuss doing as hers. Aunty had a way of declaring What Is Best For The Family, and I suppose her coming to live with us was in that category. Maycomb welcomed her. Miss Maudie Atkinson baked a Lane cake so loaded with shinny it made me tight; Miss Stephanie Crawford had long visits with Aunt Alexandra, consisting mostly of Miss Stephanie shaking her head and saying, Uh, uh, uh. Miss Rachel next door had Aunty over for coffee in the afternoons, and Mr. Nathan Radley went so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was glad to see her. When she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, Aunt Alexandra seemed as if she had always lived with us. Her Missionary Society refreshments added to her reputation as a hostess (she did not permit Calpurnia to make the delicacies required to sustain the Society through long reports on Rice Christians); she joined and became Secretary of the Maycomb Amanuensis Club. To all parties present and participating in the life of the county, Aunt Alexandra was one of the last of her kind: she had river-boat, boarding-school manners; let any moral come along and she would uphold it; she was born in the objective case; she was an incurable gossip. When Aunt Alexandra went to school, self-doubt could not be found in any textbook, so she knew not its meaning. She was never bored, and given the slightest chance she would exercise her royal prerogative: she would arrange, advise, caution, and warn. She never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of other tribal groups to the greater glory of our own, a habit that amused Jem rather than annoyed him: Aunty better watch how she talksscratch most folks in Maycomb and theyre kin to us. Aunt Alexandra, in underlining the moral of young Sam Merriweathers suicide, said it was caused by a morbid streak in the family. Let a sixteen-year-old girl giggle in the choir and Aunty would say, It just goes to show you, all the Penfield women are flighty. Everybody in Maycomb, it seemed, had a Streak: a Drinking Streak, a Gambling Streak, a Mean Streak, a Funny Streak. Once, when Aunty assured us that Miss Stephanie Crawfords tendency to mind other peoples business was hereditary, Atticus said, Sister, when you stop to think about it, our generations practically the first in the Finch family not to marry its cousins. Would you say the Finches have an Incestuous Streak? Aunty said no, thats where we got our small hands and feet. I never understood her preoccupation with heredity. Somewhere, I had received the impression that Fine Folks were people who did the best they could with the sense they had, but Aunt Alexandra was of the opinion, obliquely expressed, that the longer a family had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was. That makes the Ewells fine folks, then, said Jem. The tribe of which Burris Ewell and his brethren consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the Maycomb dump, and had thrived on county welfare money for three generations. Aunt Alexandras theory had something behind it, though. Maycomb was an ancient town. It was twenty miles east of Finchs Landing, awkwardly inland for such an old town. But Maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not been for the nimble- wittedness of one Sinkfield, who in the dawn of history operated an inn where two pig- trails met, the only tavern in the territory. Sinkfield, no patriot, served and supplied ammunition to Indians and settlers alike, neither knowing or caring whether he was a part of the Alabama Territory or the Creek Nation so long as business was good. Business was excellent when Governor William Wyatt Bibb, with a view to promoting the newly created countys domestic tranquility, dispatched a team of surveyors to locate its exact center and there establish its seat of government. The surveyors, Sinkfields guests, told their host that he was in the territorial confines of Maycomb County, and showed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built. Had not Sinkfield made a bold stroke to preserve his holdings, Maycomb would have sat in the middle of Winston Swamp, a place totally devoid of interest. Instead, Maycomb grew and sprawled out from its hub, Sinkfields Tavern, because Sinkfield reduced his guests to myopic drunkenness one evening, induced them to bring forward their maps and charts, lop off a little here, add a bit there, and adjust the center of the county to meet his requirements. He sent them packing next day armed with their charts and five quarts of shinny in their saddlebagstwo apiece and one for theGovernor. Because its primary reason for existence was government, Maycomb was spared the grubbiness that distinguished most Alabama towns its size. In the beginning its buildings were solid, its courthouse proud, its streets graciously wide. Maycombs proportion of professional people ran high: one went there to have his teeth pulled, his wagon fixed, his heart listened to, his money deposited, his soul saved, his mules vetted. But the ultimate wisdom of Sinkfields maneuver is open to question. He placed the young town too far away from the only kind of public transportation in those daysriver-boatand it took a man from the north end of the county two days to travel to Maycomb for store- bought goods. As a result the town remained the same size for a hundred years, an island in a patchwork sea of cottonfields and timberland. Although Maycomb was ignored during the War Between the States, Reconstruction rule and economic ruin forced the town to grow. It grew inward. New people so rarely settled there, the same families married the same families until the members of the community looked faintly alike. Occasionally someone would return from Montgomery or Mobile with an outsider, but the result caused only a ripple in the quiet stream of family resemblance. Things were more or less the same during my early years. There was indeed a caste system in Maycomb, but to my mind it worked this way: the older citizens, the present generation of people who had lived side by side for years and years, were utterly predictable to one another: they took for granted attitudes, character shadings, even gestures, as having been repeated in each generation and refined by time. Thus the dicta No Crawford Minds His Own Business, Every Third Merriweather Is Morbid, The Truth Is Not in the Delafields, All the Bufords Walk Like That, were simply guides to daily living: never take a check from a Delafield without a discreet call to the bank; Miss Maudie Atkinsons shoulder stoops because she was a Buford; if Mrs. Grace Merriweather sips gin out of Lydia E. Pinkham bottles its nothing unusualher mother did the same. Aunt Alexandra fitted into the world of Maycomb like a hand into a glove, but never into the world of Jem and me. I so often wondered how she could be Atticuss and Uncle Jacks sister that I revived half-remembered tales of changelings and mandrake roots that Jem had spun longago. These were abstract speculations for the first month of her stay, as she had little to say to Jem or me, and we saw her only at mealtimes and at night before we went to bed. It was summer and we were outdoors. Of course some afternoons when I would run inside for a drink of water, I would find the livingroom overrun with Maycomb ladies, sipping, whispering, fanning, and I would be called: Jean Louise, come speak to these ladies. When I appeared in the doorway, Aunty would look as if she regretted her request; I was usually mud-splashed or covered with sand. Speak to your Cousin Lily, she said one afternoon, when she had trapped me in the hall. Who? I said. Your Cousin Lily Brooke, said Aunt Alexandra. She our cousin? I didnt know that. Aunt Alexandra managed to smile in a way that conveyed a gentle apology to Cousin Lily and firm disapproval to me. When Cousin Lily Brooke left I knew I was in for it. It was a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the Finch Family, or to install any pride into his children. She summoned Jem, who sat warily on the sofa beside me. She left the room and returned with a purple-covered book on which Meditations ofJoshua S. St. Clairwas stamped in gold. Your cousin wrote this, said Aunt Alexandra. He was a beautiful character. Jem examined the small volume. Is this the Cousin Joshua who was locked up for so long? Aunt Alexandra said, How did you know that? Why, Atticus said he went round the bend at the University. Said he tried to shoot the president. Said Cousin Joshua said he wasnt anything but a sewer-inspector and tried to shoot him with an old flintlock pistol, only it just blew up in his hand. Atticus said it cost the family five hundred dollars to get him out of that one Aunt Alexandra was standing stiff as a stork. Thats all, she said. Well see about this. Before bedtime I was in Jems room trying to borrow a book, when Atticus knocked and entered. He sat on the side of Jems bed, looked at us soberly, then he grinned. Erhrm, he said. He was beginning to preface some things he said with a throaty noise, and I thought he must at last be getting old, but he looked the same. I dont exactly know how to say this, he began. Well, just say it, said Jem. Have we done something? Our father was actually fidgeting. No, I just want to explain to you thatyour Aunt Alexandra asked me son, you know youre a Finch, dont you? Thats what Ive been told. Jem looked out of the corners of his eyes. His voice rose uncontrollably, Atticus, whats the matter? Atticus crossed his knees and folded his arms. Im trying to tell you the facts of life. Jems disgust deepened. I know all that stuff, he said. Atticus suddenly grew serious. In his lawyers voice, without a shade of inflection, he said: Your aunt has asked me to try and impress upon you and Jean Louise that you are not from run-of-the-mill people, that you are the product of several generations gentle breeding Atticus paused, watching me locate an elusive redbug on my leg. Gentle breeding, he continued, when I had found and scratched it, and that you should try to live up to your name Atticus persevered in spite of us: She asked me to tell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that you are. She wants to talk to you about the family and what its meant to Maycomb County through the years, so youll have some idea of who you are, so you might be moved to behave accordingly, he concluded at a gallop. Stunned, Jem and I looked at each other, then at Atticus, whose collar seemed to worry him. We did not speak to him. Presently I picked up a comb from Jems dresser and ran its teeth along the edge. Stop that noise, Atticus said. His curtness stung me. The comb was midway in its journey, and I banged it down. For no reason I felt myself beginning to cry, but I could not stop. This was not my father. My father never thought these thoughts. My father never spoke so. Aunt Alexandra had put him up to this, somehow. Through my tears I saw Jem standing in a similar pool of isolation, his head cocked to one side. There was nowhere to go, but I turned to go and met Atticuss vest front. I buried my head in it and listened to the small internal noises that went on behind the light blue cloth: his watch ticking, the faint crackle of his starched shirt, the soft sound of his breathing. Your stomachs growling, I said. I know it, he said. You better take some soda. I will, he said. Atticus,isallthisbehavinanstuffgonnamakethingsdifferent?Imeanareyou?I felt his hand on the back of my head. Dont you worry about anything, hesaid.Its not time to worry. When I heard that, I knew he had come back to us. The blood inmy legs began to flow again, and I raised my head. You really want us to do all that? I cant remember everything Finches are supposed to do I dont want you to remember it. Forget it. He went to the door and out of the room, shutting the door behind him. He nearly slammed it, but caught himself at the last minute and closed it softly. As Jem and I stared, the door opened again and Atticus peered around. His eyebrows were raised, his glasses had slipped. Get more like Cousin Joshua every day, dont I? Do you think Ill end up costing the family five hundred dollars? I know now what he was trying to do, but Atticus was only a man. It takes a woman to do that kind of work.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch13,"As Scout and Jem begin to question Aunt Alexandra, she tells them she's come to stay awhile (which could be days or years, according to Maycomb's customs). She settles in and the county welcomes her with open arms, although she certainly adds a formidable presence to Jem and Scout's daily routine. She begins trying to instruct the two on how to be a proper Finch (since they come from, in her words, a Fine Family) but both Scout and Jem have no interest in becoming a little gentleman and a little lady, and hardly bother trying to learn."
"Although we heard no more about the Finch family from Aunt Alexandra, we heard plenty from the town. On Saturdays, armed with our nickels, when Jem permitted me to accompany him (he was now positively allergic to my presence when in public), we would squirm our way through sweating sidewalk crowds and sometimes hear, Theres his chillun, or, Yonders some Finches. Turning to face our accusers, we would see only a couple of farmers studying the enema bags in the Mayco Drugstore window. Or two dumpy countrywomen in straw hats sitting in a Hoover cart. They cn go loose and rape up the countryside for all of em who run this county care, was one obscure observation we met head on from a skinny gentleman when he passed us. Which reminded me that I had a question to ask Atticus. Whats rape? I asked him that night. Atticus looked around from behind his paper. He was in his chair by the window. As we grew older, Jem and I thought it generous to allow Atticus thirty minutes to himself after supper. He sighed, and said rape was carnal knowledge of a female by force and without consent. Well if thats all it is why did Calpurnia dry me up when I asked her what it was? Atticus looked pensive. Whats that again? Well, I asked Calpurnia comin from church that day what it was and she said ask you but I forgot to and now Im askin you. His paper was now in his lap. Again, please, he said. I told him in detail about our trip to church with Calpurnia. Atticus seemed to enjoy it, but Aunt Alexandra, who was sitting in a corner quietly sewing, put down her embroidery and stared at us. You all were coming back from Calpurnias church that Sunday? Jem said, Yessum, she took us. I remembered something. Yessum, and she promised me I could come out to her house some afternoon. Atticus. Ill go next Sunday if its all right, can I? Cal said shed come get me if you were off in the car. You maynot. Aunt Alexandra said it. I wheeled around, startled, then turned back to Atticus in time to catch his swift glance at her, but it was too late. I said, I didnt ask you! For a big man, Atticus could get up and down from a chair faster than anyone I ever knew. He was on his feet. Apologize to your aunt, he said. I didnt ask her, I asked you Atticus turned his head and pinned me to the wall with his good eye. His voice was deadly: First, apologize to your aunt. Im sorry, Aunty, I muttered. Now then, he said. Lets get this clear: you do as Calpurnia tells you, you do as I tell you, and as long as your aunts in this house, you will do as she tells you. Understand? I understood, pondered a while, and concluded that the only way I could retire with a shred of dignity was to go to the bathroom, where I stayed long enough to make them think I had to go. Returning, I lingered in the hall to hear a fierce discussion going on in the livingroom. Through the door I could see Jem on the sofa with a football magazine in front of his face, his head turning as if its pages contained a live tennis match. youve got to do something about her, Aunty was saying. Youve let things go on too long, Atticus, too long. I dont see any harm in letting her go out there. Cald look after her there as well as she does here. Who was the her they were talking about? My heart sank: me. I felt the starched walls of a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on me, and for the second time in my life I thought of running away. Immediately. Atticus, its all right to be soft-hearted, youre an easy man, but you have a daughter to think of. A daughter whos growing up. Thats what I am thinking of. And dont try to get around it. Youve got to face it sooner or later and it might as well be tonight. We dont need her now. Atticuss voice was even: Alexandra, Calpurnias not leaving this house until she wants to. You may think otherwise, but I couldnt have got along without her all these years. Shes a faithful member of this family and youll simply have to accept things the way they are. Besides, sister, I dont want you working your head off for usyouve no reason to do that. We still need Cal as much as we ever did. But Atticus Besides, I dont think the childrenve suffered one bit from her having brought them up. If anything, shes been harder on them in some ways than a mother would have been shes never let them get away with anything, shes never indulged them the way most colored nurses do. She tried to bring them up according to her lights, and Cals lights are pretty goodand another thing, the children love her. I breathed again. It wasnt me, it was only Calpurnia they were talking about. Revived, I entered the livingroom. Atticus had retreated behind his newspaper and Aunt Alexandra was worrying her embroidery. Punk, punk, punk, her needle broke the taut circle. She stopped, and pulled the cloth tighter: punk-punk-punk. She was furious. Jem got up and padded across the rug. He motioned me to follow. He led me to his room and closed the door. His face was grave. Theyve been fussing, Scout. Jem and I fussed a great deal these days, but I had never heard of or seen anyone quarrel with Atticus. It was not a comfortable sight. Scout, try not to antagonize Aunty, hear? Atticuss remarks were still rankling, which made me miss the request in Jems question. My feathers rose again. You tryin to tell me what to do? Naw, itshes got a lot on his mind now, without us worrying him. Like what? Atticus didnt appear to have anything especially on his mind. Its this Tom Robinson case thats worryin him to death I said Atticus didnt worry about anything. Besides, the case never bothered us except about once a week and then it didnt last. Thats because you cant hold something in your mind but a little while, said Jem. Its different with grown folks, we His maddening superiority was unbearable these days. He didnt want to do anything but read and go off by himself. Still, everything he read he passed along to me, but with this difference: formerly, because he thought Id like it; now, for my edification and instruction. Jee crawling hova, Jem! Who do you think you are? Now I mean it, Scout, you antagonize Aunty and IllIll spank you. With that, I was gone. You damn morphodite, Ill kill you! He was sitting on the bed, and it was easy to grab his front hair and land one on his mouth. He slapped me and I tried another left, but a punch in the stomach sent me sprawling on the floor. It nearly knocked the breath out of me, but it didnt matter because I knew he was fighting, he was fighting me back. We were still equals. Aint so high and mighty now, are you! I screamed, sailing in again. He was still on the bed and I couldnt get a firm stance, so I threw myself at him as hard as I could, hitting, pulling, pinching, gouging. What had begun as a fist-fight became a brawl. We were still struggling when Atticus separated us. Thats all, he said. Both of you go to bed right now. Taah! I said at Jem. He was being sent to bed at my bedtime. Who started it? asked Atticus, in resignation. Jem did. He was tryin to tell me what to do. I dont have to mindhimnow, do I? Atticus smiled. Lets leave it at this: you mind Jem whenever he can make you. Fair enough? Aunt Alexandra was present but silent, and when she went down the hall with Atticus we heard her say, just one of the things Ive been telling you about, a phrase that united us again. Ours were adjoining rooms; as I shut the door between them Jem said, Night, Scout. Night, I murmured, picking my way across the room to turn on the light. As I passed the bed I stepped on something warm, resilient, and rather smooth. It was not quite like hard rubber, and I had the sensation that it was alive. I also heard it move. I switched on the light and looked at the floor by the bed. Whatever I had stepped on was gone. I tapped on Jems door. What, he said. How does a snake feel? Sort of rough. Cold. Dusty. Why? I think theres one under my bed. Can you come look? Are you bein funny? Jem opened the door. He was in his pajama bottoms. I noticed not without satisfaction that the mark of my knuckles was still on his mouth. When he saw I meant what I said, he said, If you think Im gonna put my face down to a snake youve got another think comin. Hold on a minute. He went to the kitchen and fetched the broom. You better get up on the bed, he said. You reckon its really one? I asked. This was an occasion. Our houses had no cellars; they were built on stone blocks a few feet above the ground, and the entry of reptiles was not unknown but was not commonplace. Miss Rachel Haverfords excuse for a glass of neat whiskey every morning was that she never got over the fright of finding a rattler coiled in her bedroom closet, on her washing, when she went to hang up her negligee. Jem made a tentative swipe under the bed. I looked over the foot to see if a snake would come out. None did. Jem made a deeper swipe. Do snakes grunt? It aint a snake, Jem said. Its somebody. Suddenly a filthy brown package shot from under the bed. Jem raised the broom and missed Dills head by an inch when it appeared. God Almighty. Jems voice was reverent. We watched Dill emerge by degrees. He was a tight fit. He stood up and eased his shoulders, turned his feet in their ankle sockets, rubbed the back of his neck. His circulation restored, he said, Hey. Jem petitioned God again. I was speechless. Im bout to perish, said Dill. Got anything to eat? In a dream, I went to the kitchen. I brought him back some milk and half a pan of corn bread left over from supper. Dill devoured it, chewing with his front teeth, as was his custom. I finally found my voice. Howd you get here? By an involved route. Refreshed by food, Dill recited this narrative: having been bound in chains and left to die in the basement (there were basements in Meridian) by his new father, who disliked him, and secretly kept alive on raw field peas by a passing farmer who heard his cries for help (the good man poked a bushel pod by pod through the ventilator), Dill worked himself free by pulling the chains from the wall. Still in wrist manacles, he wandered two miles out of Meridian where he discovered a small animal show and was immediately engaged to wash the camel. He traveled with the show all over Mississippi until his infallible sense of direction told him he was in Abbott County, Alabama, just across the river from Maycomb. He walked the rest of the way. Howd you get here? asked Jem. He had taken thirteen dollars from his mothers purse, caught the nine oclock from Meridian and got off at Maycomb Junction. He had walked ten or eleven of the fourteen miles to Maycomb, off the highway in the scrub bushes lest the authorities be seeking him, and had ridden the remainder of the way clinging to the backboard of a cotton wagon. He had been under the bed for two hours, he thought; he had heard us in the diningroom, and the clink of forks on plates nearly drove him crazy. He thought Jem and I would never go to bed; he had considered emerging and helping me beat Jem, as Jem had grown far taller, but he knew Mr. Finch would break it up soon, so he thought it best to stay where he was. He was worn out, dirty beyond belief, and home. They must not know youre here, said Jem. Wed know if they were lookin for you Think theyre still searchin all the picture shows in Meridian. Dill grinned. You oughta let your mother know where you are, said Jem. You oughta let her know youre here Dills eyes flickered at Jem, and Jem looked at the floor. Then he rose and broke the remaining code of our childhood. He went out of the room and down the hall. Atticus, his voice was distant, can you come here a minute, sir? Beneath its sweat-streaked dirt Dills face went white. I felt sick. Atticus was in the doorway. He came to the middle of the room and stood with his hands in his pockets, looking down at Dill. I finally found my voice: Its okay, Dill. When he wants you to know somethin, he tells you. Dill looked at me. I mean its all right, I said. You know he wouldnt bother you, you know you aint scared of Atticus. Im not scared Dill muttered. Justhungry,Illbet.Atticussvoicehaditsusualpleasantdryness.Scout,wecando better than a pan of cold corn bread, cant we? You fill this fellow up and when I get back well see what we cansee. Mr. Finch, dont tell Aunt Rachel, dont make me go back,pleasesir! Ill run off again! Whoa, son, said Atticus. Nobodys about to make you go anywhere but to bed pretty soon. Im just going over to tell Miss Rachel youre here and ask her if you could spend the night with usyoud like that, wouldnt you? And for goodness sake put some of the county back where it belongs, the soil erosions bad enough as it is. Dill stared at my fathers retreating figure. Hes tryin to be funny, I said. He means take a bath. See there, I told you he wouldnt bother you. Jem was standing in a corner of the room, looking like the traitor he was. Dill, I had to tell him, he said. You cant run three hundred miles off without your mother knowin. We left him without a word. Dill ate, and ate, and ate. He hadnt eaten since last night. He used all his money for a ticket, boarded the train as he had done many times, coolly chatted with the conductor, to whom Dill was a familiar sight, but he had not the nerve to invoke the rule on small children traveling a distance alone if youve lost your money the conductor will lend you enough for dinner and your father will pay him back at the end of the line. Dill made his way through the leftovers and was reaching for a can of pork and beans in the pantry when Miss Rachels Do-oo Je-sus went off in the hall. He shivered like a rabbit. He bore with fortitude her Wait Till I Get You Home, Your Folks Are Out of Their Minds Worryin, was quite calm during Thats All the Harris in You Coming Out, smiled at her Reckon You Can Stay One Night, and returned the hug at long last bestowed upon him. Atticus pushed up his glasses and rubbed his face. Your fathers tired, said Aunt Alexandra, her first words in hours, it seemed. She had been there, but I suppose struck dumb most of the time. You children get to bed now. We left them in the diningroom, Atticus still mopping his face. From rape to riot to runaways, we heard him chuckle. I wonder what the next two hours will bring. Since things appeared to have worked out pretty well, Dill and I decided to be civil to Jem. Besides, Dill had to sleep with him so we might as well speak to him. I put on my pajamas, read for a while and found myself suddenly unable to keep my eyes open. Dill and Jem were quiet; when I turned off my reading lamp there was no strip of light under the door to Jems room. I must have slept a long time, for when I was punched awake the room was dim with the light of the setting moon. Move over, Scout. He thought he had to, I mumbled. Dont stay mad with him. Dill got in bed beside me. I aint, he said. I just wanted to sleep with you. Are you waked up? By this time I was, but lazily so. Whyd you do it? No answer. I said whyd you run off? Was he really hateful like you said? Naw Didnt you all build that boat like you wrote you were gonna? He just said we would. We never did. I raised up on my elbow, facing Dills outline. Its no reason to run off. They dont get around to doin what they say theyre gonna do half the time That wasnt it, hethey just wasnt interested in me. This was the weirdest reason for flight I had ever heard. How come? Well, they stayed gone all the time, and when they were home, even, theyd get off in a room by themselves. Whatd they do in there? Nothin, just sittin and readinbut they didnt want me with em. I pushed the pillow to the headboard and sat up. You know something? I was fixin to run off tonight because there they all were. You dont want em around you all the time, Dill Dill breathed his patient breath, a half-sigh. good night, Atticuss gone all day and sometimes half the night and off in the legislature and I dont know whatyou dont want em around all the time, Dill, 
ou couldnt do anything if they were. Thats not it. As Dill explained, I found myself wondering what life would be if Jem were different, even from what he was now; what I would do if Atticus did not feel the necessity of my presence, help and advice. Why, he couldnt get along a day without me. Even Calpurnia couldnt get along unless I was there. They needed me. Dill, you aint telling me rightyour folks couldnt do without you. They must be just mean to you. Tell you what to do about that Dills voice went on steadily in the darkness: The thing is, what Im tryin to say is they do get on a lot better without me, I cant help them any. They aint mean. They buy me everything I want, but its nowyouve-got-it-go-play-with-it. Youve got a roomful of things. I-got-you-that-book-so-go-read-it. Dill tried to deepen his voice. Youre not a boy. Boys get out and play baseball with other boys, they dont hang around the house worryin their folks. Dills voice was his own again: Oh, they aint mean. They kiss you and hug you good night and good mornin and good-bye and tell you they love youScout, lets get us a baby. Where? There was a man Dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggy island where all these babies were; you could order one Thats a lie. Aunty said God drops em down the chimney. At least thats what I think she said. For once, Auntys diction had not been too clear. Well that aint so. You get babies from each other. But theres this man, toohe has all these babies just waitin to wake up, he breathes life into em Dill was off again. Beautiful things floated around in his dreamy head. He could read two books to my one, but he preferred the magic of his own inventions. He could add and subtract faster than lightning, but he preferred his own twilight world, a world where babies slept, waiting to be gathered like morning lilies. He was slowly talking himself to sleep and taking me with him, but in the quietness of his foggy island there rose the faded image of a gray house with sad brown doors. Dill? Mm? Why do you reckon Boo Radleys never run off? Dill sighed a long sigh and turned away from me. Maybe he doesnt have anywhere to run off to",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch14,"As life continues on with Aunty in the house, one night Scout goes to bed and steps on something soft and warm and round, which she thinks is a snake. After calling Jem in for a thorough investigation under her bed they find Dill under there, dirty and starving and still his same old self. Scout finds out that the reason why Dill ran off was because his parents just aren't interested in him, and he spends most of his days alone. He spends the night with them, uncertain what the next day will bring."
"After many telephone calls, much pleading on behalf of the defendant, and a long forgiving letter from his mother, it was decided that Dill could stay. We had a week of peace together. After that, little, it seemed. A nightmare was upon us. It began one evening after supper. Dill was over; Aunt Alexandra was in her chair in the corner, Atticus was in his; Jem and I were on the floor reading. It had been a placid week: I had minded Aunty; Jem had outgrown the treehouse, but helped Dill and me construct a new rope ladder for it; Dill had hit upon a foolproof plan to make Boo Radley come out at no cost to ourselves (place a trail of lemon drops from the back door to the front yard and hed follow it, like an ant). There was a knock on the front door, Jem answered it and said it was Mr. Heck Tate. Well, ask him to come in, said Atticus. I already did. Theres some men outside in the yard, they want you to come out. In Maycomb, grown men stood outside in the front yard for only two reasons: death and politics. I wondered who had died. Jem and I went to the front door, but Atticus called, Go back in the house. Jem turned out the livingroom lights and pressed his nose to a window screen. Aunt Alexandra protested. Just for a second, Aunty, lets see who it is, he said. Dill and I took another window. A crowd of men was standing around Atticus. They all seemed to be talking at once. movin him to the county jail tomorrow, Mr. Tate was saying, I dont look for any trouble, but I cant guarantee there wont be any Dont be foolish, Heck, Atticus said. This is Maycomb. said I was just uneasy. Heck, weve gotten one postponement of this case just to make sure theres nothing to be uneasy about. This is Saturday, Atticus said. Trialll probably be Monday. You can keep him one night, cant you? I dont think anybody in Maycombll begrudge me a client, with times this hard. There was a murmur of glee that died suddenly when Mr. Link Deas said, Nobody around heres up to anything, its that Old Sarum bunch Im worried about cant you get awhat is it, Heck? Change of venue, said Mr. Tate. Not much point in that, now is it? Atticus said something inaudible. I turned to Jem, who waved me to silence. besides, Atticus was saying, youre not scared of that crowd, are you? know how they do when they get shinniedup. They dont usually drink on Sunday, they go to church most of the day Atticus said. This is a special occasion, though someone said. They murmured and buzzed until Aunty said if Jem didnt turn on the livingroom lights he would disgrace the family. Jem didnt hear her. dont see why you touched it in the first place, Mr. Link Deas was saying. Youve got everything to lose from this, Atticus. I mean everything. Do you really think so? This was Atticuss dangerous question. Do you really think you want to move there, Scout? Bam, bam, bam, and the checkerboard was swept clean of my men. Do you really think that, son? Then read this. Jem would struggle the rest of an evening through the speeches of Henry W. Grady. Link, that boy might go to the chair, but hes not going till the truths told. Atticuss voice was even. And you know what the truth is. There was a murmur among the group of men, made more ominous when Atticus moved back to the bottom front step and the men drew nearer to him. Suddenly Jem screamed, Atticus, the telephones ringing! The men jumped a little and scattered; they were people we saw every day: merchants, in-town farmers; Dr. Reynolds was there; so was Mr. Avery. Well, answer it, son, called Atticus. Laughter broke them up. When Atticus switched on the overhead light in the livingroom he found Jem at the window, pale except for the vivid mark of the screen on his nose. Why on earth are you all sitting in the dark? he asked. Jem watched him go to his chair and pick up the evening paper. I sometimes think Atticus subjected every crisis of his life to tranquil evaluation behind The Mobile Register,The Birmingham NewsandThe Montgomery Advertiser. They were after you, werent they? Jem went to him. They wanted to get you, didnt they? Atticus lowered the paper and gazed at Jem. What have you been reading? he asked. Then he said gently, No son, those were our friends. It wasnt aa gang? Jem was looking from the corners of his eyes. Atticus tried to stifle a smile but didnt make it. No, we dont have mobs and that nonsense in Maycomb. Ive never heard of a gang in Maycomb. Ku Klux got after some Catholics one time. Never heard of any Catholics in Maycomb either, said Atticus, youre confusing that with something else. Way back about nineteen-twenty there was a Klan, but it was a political organization more than anything. Besides, they couldnt find anybody to scare. They paraded by Mr. Sam Levys house one night, but Sam just stood on his porch and told em things had come to a pretty pass, hed sold em the very sheets on their backs. Sam made em so ashamed of themselves they went away. The Levy family met all criteria for being Fine Folks: they did the best they could with the sense they had, and they had been living on the same plot of ground in Maycomb for five generations. The Ku Kluxs gone, said Atticus. Itll never come back. I walked home with Dill and returned in time to overhear Atticus saying to Aunty, in favor of Southern womanhood as much as anybody, but not for preserving polite fiction at the expense of human life, a pronouncement that made me suspect they had been fussingagain. I sought Jem and found him in his room, on the bed deep in thought. Have they been at it? Iasked. Sort of. She wont let him alone about Tom Robinson. She almost said Atticus was disgracin the family. Scout Im scared. Scareda what? Scared about Atticus. Somebody might hurt him. Jem preferred to remain mysterious; all he would say to my questions was go on and leave him alone. Next day was Sunday. In the interval between Sunday School and Church when the congregation stretched its legs, I saw Atticus standing in the yard with another knot of men. Mr. Heck Tate was present, and I wondered if he had seen the light. He never went to church. Even Mr. Underwood was there. Mr. Underwood had no use for any organization butThe Maycomb Tribune, of which he was the sole owner, editor, and printer. His days were spent at his linotype, where he refreshed himself occasionally from an ever-present gallon jug of cherry wine. He rarely gathered news; people brought it to him. It was said that he made up every edition ofThe Maycomb Tribuneout of his own head and wrote it down on the linotype. This was believable. Something must have been up to haul Mr. Underwoodout. I caught Atticus coming in the door, and he said that theyd moved Tom Robinson to the Maycomb jail. He also said, more to himself than to me, that if theyd kept him there in the first place there wouldnt have been any fuss. I watched him take his seat on the third row from the front, and I heard him rumble, Nearer my God to thee, some notes behind the rest of us. He never sat with Aunty, Jem and me. He liked to be by himself in church. The fake peace that prevailed on Sundays was made more irritating by Aunt Alexandras presence. Atticus would flee to his office directly after dinner, where if we sometimes looked in on him, we would find him sitting back in his swivel chair reading. Aunt Alexandra composed herself for a two-hour nap and dared us to make any noise in the yard, the neighborhood was resting. Jem in his old age had taken to his room with a stack of football magazines. So Dill and I spent our Sundays creeping around in Deers Pasture. Shooting on Sundays was prohibited, so Dill and I kicked Jems football around the pasture for a while, which was no fun. Dill asked if Id like to have a poke at Boo Radley. I said I didnt think itd be nice to bother him, and spent the rest of the afternoon filling Dill in on last winters events. He was considerably impressed. We parted at suppertime, and after our meal Jem and I were settling down to a routine evening, when Atticus did something that interested us: he came into the livingroom carrying a long electrical extension cord. There was a light bulb on the end. Im going out for a while, he said. You folksll be in bed when I come back, so Ill say good night now. With that, he put his hat on and went out the back door. Hes takin the car, said Jem. Our father had a few peculiarities: one was, he never ate desserts; another was that he liked to walk. As far back as I could remember, there was always a Chevrolet in excellent condition in the carhouse, and Atticus put many miles on it in business trips, but in Maycomb he walked to and from his office four times a day, covering about two miles. He said his only exercise was walking. In Maycomb, if one went for a walk with no definite purpose in mind, it was correct to believe ones mind incapable of definite purpose. Later on, I bade my aunt and brother good night and was well into a book when I heard Jem rattling around in his room. His go-to-bed noises were so familiar to me that I knocked on his door: Why aint you going to bed? Im goin downtown for a while. He was changing his pants. Why? Its almost ten oclock, Jem. He knew it, but he was going anyway. Then Im goin with you. If you say no youre not, Im goin anyway, hear? Jem saw that he would have to fight me to keep me home, and I suppose he thought a fight would antagonize Aunty, so he gave in with little grace. I dressed quickly. We waited until Auntys light went out, and we walked quietly down the back steps. There was no moon tonight. Dillll wanta come, I whispered. So he will, said Jem gloomily. We leaped over the driveway wall, cut through Miss Rachels side yard and went to Dills window. Jem whistled bob-white. Dills face appeared at the screen, disappeared, and five minutes later he unhooked the screen and crawled out. An old campaigner, he did not speak until we were on the sidewalk. Whats up? Jems got the look-arounds, an affliction Calpurnia said all boys caught at his age. Ive just got this feeling, Jem said, just this feeling. We went by Mrs. Duboses house, standing empty and shuttered, her camellias grown up in weeds and johnson grass. There were eight more houses to the post office corner. The south side of the square was deserted. Giant monkey-puzzle bushes bristled on each corner, and between them an iron hitching rail glistened under the street lights. A light shone in the county toilet, otherwise that side of the courthouse was dark. A larger square of stores surrounded the courthouse square; dim lights burned from deep within them. Atticuss office was in the courthouse when he began his law practice, but after several years of it he moved to quieter quarters in the Maycomb Bank building. When we rounded the corner of the square, we saw the car parked in front of the bank. Hes in there, said Jem. But he wasnt. His office was reached by a long hallway. Looking down the hall, we should have seenAtticus Finch, Attorney-at-Lawin small sober letters against the light from behind his door. It was dark. Jem peered in the bank door to make sure. He turned the knob. The door was locked. Lets go up the street. Maybe hes visitin Mr. Underwood. Mr. Underwood not only ranThe Maycomb Tribuneoffice, he lived in it. That is, above it. He covered the courthouse and jailhouse news simply by looking out his upstairs window. The office building was on the northwest corner of the square, and to reach it we had to pass the jail. The Maycomb jail was the most venerable and hideous of the countys buildings. Atticus said it was like something Cousin Joshua St. Clair might have designed. It was certainly someones dream. Starkly out of place in a town of square-faced stores and steep-roofed houses, the Maycomb jail was a miniature Gothic joke one cell wide and two cells high, complete with tiny battlements and flying buttresses. Its fantasy was heightened by its red brick facade and the thick steel bars at its ecclesiastical windows. It stood on no lonely hill, but was wedged between Tyndals Hardware Store andTheMaycomb Tribune office. The jail was Maycombs only conversation piece: its detractors said it looked like a Victorian privy; its supporters said it gave the town a good solid respectable look, and no stranger would ever suspect that it was full of niggers. As we walked up the sidewalk, we saw a solitary light burning in the distance. Thats funny, said Jem, jail doesnt have an outside light. Looks like its over the door, said Dill. A long extension cord ran between the bars of a second-floor window and down the side of the building. In the light from its bare bulb, Atticus was sitting propped against the front door. He was sitting in one of his office chairs, and he was reading, oblivious of the nightbugs dancing over hishead. I made to run, but Jem caught me. Dont go to him, he said, he might not like it. Hes all right, lets go home. I just wanted to see where he was. We were taking a short cut across the square when four dusty cars came in from the Meridian highway, moving slowly in a line. They went around the square, passed the bank building, and stopped in front of the jail. Nobody got out. We saw Atticus look up from his newspaper. He closed it, folded it deliberately, dropped it in his lap, and pushed his hat to the back of his head. He seemed to be expecting them. Come on, whispered Jem. We streaked across the square, across the street, until we were in the shelter of the Jitney Jungle door. Jem peeked up the sidewalk. We can get closer, he said. We ran to Tyndals Hardware doornear enough, at the same time discreet. In ones and twos, men got out of the cars. Shadows became substance as lights revealed solid shapes moving toward the jail door. Atticus remained where he was. The men hid him from view. He in there, Mr. Finch? a man said. He is, we heard Atticus answer, and hes asleep. Dont wake him up. In obedience to my father, there followed what I later realized was a sickeningly comic aspect of an unfunny situation: the men talked in near-whispers. You know what we want, another man said. Get aside from the door, Mr. Finch. You can turn around and go home again, Walter, Atticus said pleasantly. Heck Tates around somewhere. The hell he is, said another man. Hecks bunchs so deep in the woods they wont get out till mornin. Indeed? Why so? Called em off on a snipe hunt, was the succinct answer. Didnt you think athat, Mr. Finch? Thought about it, but didnt believe it. Well then, my fathers voice was still the same, that changes things, doesnt it? It do, another deep voice said. Its owner was a shadow. Do you really think so? This was the second time I heard Atticus ask that question in two days, and it meant somebodys man would get jumped. This was too good to miss. I broke away from Jem and ran as fast as I could to Atticus. Jem shrieked and tried to catch me, but I had a lead on him and Dill. I pushed my way through dark smelly bodies and burst into the circle of light. H-ey, Atticus! I thought he would have a fine surprise, but his face killed my joy. A flash of plain fear was going out of his eyes, but returned when Dill and Jem wriggled into the light. There was a smell of stale whiskey and pigpen about, and when I glanced around I discovered that these men were strangers. They were not the people I saw last night. Hot embarrassment shot through me: I had leaped triumphantly into a ring of people I had never seen before. Atticus got up from his chair, but he was moving slowly, like an old man. He put the newspaper down very carefully, adjusting its creases with lingering fingers. They were trembling a little. Go home, Jem, he said. Take Scout and Dill home. We were accustomed to prompt, if not always cheerful acquiescence to Atticuss instructions, but from the way he stood Jem was not thinking of budging. Go home, I said. Jem shook his head. As Atticuss fists went to his hips, so did Jems, and as they faced each other I could see little resemblance between them: Jems soft brown hair and eyes, his oval face 
nd snug-fitting ears were our mothers, contrasting oddly with Atticuss graying black hair and square-cut features, but they were somehow alike. Mutual defiance made them alike. Son, I said go home. Jem shook his head. Ill send him home, a burly man said, and grabbed Jem roughly by the collar. He yanked Jem nearly off his feet. Dont you touch him! I kicked the man swiftly. Barefooted, I was surprised to see him fall back in real pain. I intended to kick his shin, but aimed too high. Thatll do, Scout. Atticus put his hand on my shoulder. Dont kick folks. No he said, as I was pleading justification. Aint nobody gonna do Jem that way, I said. All right, Mr. Finch, get em outa here, someone growled. You got fifteen seconds to get em outa here. In the midst of this strange assembly, Atticus stood trying to make Jem mind him. I aint going, was his steady answer to Atticuss threats, requests, and finally, Please Jem, take them home. I was getting a bit tired of that, but felt Jem had his own reasons for doing as he did, in view of his prospects once Atticus did get him home. I looked around the crowd. It was a summers night, but the men were dressed, most of them, in overalls and denim shirts buttoned up to the collars. I thought they must be cold-natured, as their sleeves were unrolled and buttoned at the cuffs. Some wore hats pulled firmly down over their ears. They were sullen-looking, sleepy-eyed men who seemed unused to late hours. I sought once more for a familiar face, and at the center of the semi-circle I found one. Hey, Mr. Cunningham. The man did not hear me, it seemed. Hey, Mr. Cunningham. Hows your entailment gettin along? Mr. Walter Cunninghams legal affairs were well known to me; Atticus had once described them at length. The big man blinked and hooked his thumbs in his overall straps. He seemed uncomfortable; he cleared his throat and looked away. My friendly overture had fallen flat. Mr. Cunningham wore no hat, and the top half of his forehead was white in contrast to his sunscorched face, which led me to believe that he wore one most days. He shifted his feet, clad in heavy work shoes. Dont you remember me, Mr. Cunningham? Im Jean Louise Finch. You brought us some hickory nuts one time, remember? I began to sense the futility one feels when unacknowledged by a chance acquaintance. I go to school with Walter, I began again. Hes your boy, aint he? Aint he, sir? Mr. Cunningham was moved to a faint nod. He did know me, after all. Hes in my grade, I said, and he does right well. Hes a good boy, I added, a real nice boy. We brought him home for dinner one time. Maybe he told you about me, I beat him up one time but he was real nice about it. Tell him hey for me, wontyou? Atticushadsaiditwasthepolitethingtotalktopeopleaboutwhattheywere interested in, not about what you were interested in. Mr. Cunningham displayed no interest in his son, so I tackled his entailment once more in a last-ditch effort to make him feel at home. Entailments are bad, I was advising him, when I slowly awoke to the fact that I was addressing the entire aggregation. The men were all looking at me, some had their mouths half-open. Atticus had stopped poking at Jem: they were standing together beside Dill. Their attention amounted to fascination. Atticuss mouth, even, was half- open, an attitude he had once described as uncouth. Our eyes met and he shut it. Well, Atticus, I was just sayin to Mr. Cunningham that entailments are bad an all that, but you said not to worry, it takes a long time sometimes that you alld ride it out together I was slowly drying up, wondering what idiocy I had committed. Entailments seemed all right enough for livingroom talk. I began to feel sweat gathering at the edges of my hair; I could stand anything but a bunch of people looking at me. They were quite still. Whats the matter? I asked. Atticus said nothing. I looked around and up at Mr. Cunningham, whose face was equally impassive. Then he did a peculiar thing. He squatted down and took me by both shoulders. Ill tell him you said hey, little lady, he said. Then he straightened up and waved a big paw. Lets clear out, he called. Lets get going, boys. As they had come, in ones and twos the men shuffled back to their ramshackle cars. Doors slammed, engines coughed, and they were gone. I turned to Atticus, but Atticus had gone to the jail and was leaning against it with his face to the wall. I went to him and pulled his sleeve. Can we go home now? He nodded, produced his handkerchief, gave his face a going-over and blew his nose violently. Mr. Finch? A soft husky voice came from the darkness above: They gone? Atticus stepped back and looked up. Theyve gone, he said. Get some sleep, Tom. They wont bother you any more. From a different direction, another voice cut crisply through the night: Youre damn tootin they wont. Had you covered all the time, Atticus. Mr. Underwood and a double-barreled shotgun were leaning out his window above The Maycomb Tribuneoffice. It was long past my bedtime and I was growing quite tired; it seemed that Atticus and Mr. Underwood would talk for the rest of the night, Mr. Underwood out the window and Atticus up at him. Finally Atticus returned, switched off the light above the jail door, and picked up his chair. Can I carry it for you, Mr. Finch? asked Dill. He had not said a word the wholetime. Why, thank you,son. Walking toward the office, Dill and I fell into step behind Atticus and Jem. Dill was encumberedbythechair,andhispacewasslower.AtticusandJemwerewellaheadof us, and I assumed that Atticus was giving him hell for not going home, but I was wrong. As they passed under a streetlight, Atticus reached out and massaged Jems hair, his one gesture ofaffection.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch15,"It is decided a week later that Dill will stay in Maycomb with his Aunt Rachel, who happens to be the Finch's neighbor. This news makes both Scout and Jem very happy. One night they're all relaxing in the living room when Mr. Heck Tate, the sheriff, comes knocking at the door with a group of men, warning Atticus that the local group of no-accounts might try to come at Tom Robinson this weekend. He is being held in the Maycomb jail. The next night Atticus mysteriously leaves the house and on a hunch Jem, Scout and Dill go looking for him in town. They finally find him reading a book on the porch at the jailhouse. Once Jem is satisfied that Atticus is ok they turn to go, but suddenly a line of cars pull up and a group of men get out and surround the porch. Things get serious when Scout, Jem, and Dill rush into the crowd to Atticus's defense, and although he tells them to go home they don't budge. Scout realizes that these men are strangers, and that they're here to get Tom Robinson. Scout finally sees that she does know one man in the crowd, Mr. Cunningham, Walter's father, and as she tries to make conversation with him the entire group falls silent, listening to her talk about Walter and Mr. Cunningham's entailment, which Atticus is currently helping him out on. Although she doesn't realize it, she makes them all realize that they are acting barbaric and finally it's Mr. Cunningham who calls off the mob and makes everyone go home."
"Jem heard me. He thrust his head around the connecting door. As he came to my bed Atticuss light flashed on. We stayed where we were until it went off; we heard him turn over, and we waited until he was still again. Jem took me to his room and put me in bed beside him. Try to go to sleep, he said, Itll be all over after tomorrow, maybe. We had come in quietly, so as not to wake Aunty. Atticus killed the engine in the driveway and coasted to the carhouse; we went in the back door and to our rooms without a word. I was very tired, and was drifting into sleep when the memory of Atticus calmly folding his newspaper and pushing back his hat became Atticus standing in the middle of an empty waiting street, pushing up his glasses. The full meaning of the nights events hit me and I began crying. Jem was awfully nice about it: for once he didnt remind me that people nearly nine years old didnt do things like that. Everybodys appetite was delicate this morning, except Jems: he ate his way through three eggs. Atticus watched in frank admiration; Aunt Alexandra sipped coffee and radiated waves of disapproval. Children who slipped out at night were a disgrace to the family. Atticus said he was right glad his disgraces had come along, but Aunty said, Nonsense, Mr. Underwood was there all the time. You know, its a funny thing about Braxton, said Atticus. He despises Negroes, wont have one near him. Local opinion held Mr. Underwood to be an intense, profane little man, whose father in a fey fit of humor christened Braxton Bragg, a name Mr. Underwood had done his best to live down. Atticus said naming people after Confederate generals made slow steady drinkers. Calpurnia was serving Aunt Alexandra more coffee, and she shook her head at what I thought was a pleading winning look. Youre still too little, she said. Ill tell you when you aint. I said it might help my stomach. All right, she said, and got a cup from the sideboard. She poured one tablespoonful of coffee into it and filled the cup to the brim with milk. I thanked her by sticking out my tongue at it, and looked up to catch Auntys warning frown. But she was frowning at Atticus. She waited until Calpurnia was in the kitchen, then she said, Dont talk like that in front of them. Talk like what in front of whom? he asked. Like that in front of Calpurnia. You said Braxton Underwood despises Negroes right in front of her. Well, Im sure Cal knows it. Everybody in Maycomb knows it. I was beginning to notice a subtle change in my father these days, that came out when he talked with Aunt Alexandra. It was a quiet digging in, never outright irritation. There was a faint starchiness in his voice when he said, Anything fit to say at the tables fit to say in front of Calpurnia. She knows what she means to this family. I dont think its a good habit, Atticus. It encourages them. You know how they talk among themselves. Every thing that happens in this towns out to the Quarters before sundown. My father put down his knife. I dont know of any law that says they cant talk. Maybe if we didnt give them so much to talk about theyd be quiet. Why dont you drink your coffee, Scout? I was playing in it with the spoon. I thought Mr. Cunningham was a friend of ours. You told me a long time ago he was. He still is. But last night he wanted to hurt you. Atticus placed his fork beside his knife and pushed his plate aside. Mr. Cunninghams basically a good man, he said, he just has his blind spots along with the rest of us. Jem spoke. Dont call that a blind spot. Heda killed you last night when he first went there. He might have hurt me a little, Atticus conceded, but son, youll understand folks a little better when youre older. A mobs always made up of people, no matter what. Mr. Cunningham was part of a mob last night, but he was still a man. Every mob in every little Southern town is always made up of people you knowdoesnt say much for them, does it? Ill say not, said Jem. So it took an eight-year-old child to bring em to their senses, didnt it? said Atticus. That proves somethingthat a gang of wild animals can be stopped, simply because theyre still human. Hmp, maybe we need a police force of children you children last night made Walter Cunningham stand in my shoes for a minute. That was enough. Well, I hoped Jem would understand folks a little better when he was older; I wouldnt. First day Walter comes back to schoolll be his last, I affirmed. You will not touch him, Atticus said flatly. I dont want either of you bearing a grudge about this thing, no matter what happens. You see, dont you, said Aunt Alexandra, what comes of things like this. Dont say I havent told you. Atticus said hed never say that, pushed out his chair and got up. Theres a day ahead, so excuse me. Jem, I dont want you and Scout downtown today, please. As Atticus departed, Dill came bounding down the hall into the diningroom. Its all over town this morning, he announced, all about how we held off a hundred folks with our bare hands Aunt Alexandra stared him to silence. It was not a hundred folks, she said, and nobody held anybody off. It was just a nest of those Cunninghams, drunk and disorderly. Aw, Aunty, thats just Dills way, said Jem. He signaled us to follow him. You all stay in the yard today, she said, as we made our way to the front porch. It was like Saturday. People from the south end of the county passed our house in a leisurely but steady stream. Mr. Dolphus Raymond lurched by on his thoroughbred. Dont see how he stays in the saddle, murmured Jem. How cn you stand to get drunk fore eight in the morning? A wagonload of ladies rattled past us. They wore cotton sunbonnets and dresses with long sleeves. A bearded man in a wool hat drove them. Yonders some Mennonites, Jem said to Dill. They dont have buttons. They lived deep in the woods, did most of their trading across the river, and rarely came to Maycomb. Dill was interested. Theyve all got blue eyes, Jem explained, and the men cant shave after they marry. Their wives like for em to tickle em with their beards. Mr. X Billups rode by on a mule and waved to us. Hes a funny man, said Jem. Xs his name, not his initial. He was in court one time and they asked him his name. He said X Billups. Clerk asked him to spell it and he said X. Asked him again and he said X. They kept at it till he wrote X on a sheet of paper and held it up for everybody to see. They asked him where he got his name and he said thats the way his folks signed him up when he was born. As the county went by us, Jem gave Dill the histories and general attitudes of the more prominent figures: Mr. Tensaw Jones voted the straight Prohibition ticket; Miss Emily Davis dipped snuff in private; Mr. Byron Waller could play the violin; Mr. Jake Slade was cutting his third set of teeth. A wagonload of unusually stern-faced citizens appeared. When they pointed to Miss Maudie Atkinsons yard, ablaze with summer flowers, Miss Maudie herself came out on the porch. There was an odd thing about Miss Maudieon her porch she was too far away for us to see her features clearly, but we could always catch her mood by the way she stood. She was now standing arms akimbo, her shoulders drooping a little, her head cocked to one side, her glasses winking in the sunlight. We knew she wore a grin of the uttermost wickedness. The driver of the wagon slowed down his mules, and a shrill-voiced woman called out: He that cometh in vanity departeth in darkness! Miss Maudie answered: A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance! I guess that the foot-washers thought that the Devil was quoting Scripture for his own purposes, as the driver speeded his mules. Why they objected to Miss Maudies yard was a mystery, heightened in my mind because for someone who spent all the daylight hours outdoors, Miss Maudies command of Scripture was formidable. You goin to court this morning? asked Jem. We had strolled over. I am not, she said. I have no business with the court this morning. Arent you goin down to watch? asked Dill. I am not. ts morbid, watching a poor devil on trial for his life. Look at all those folks, its like a Roman carnival. They hafta try him in public, Miss Maudie, I said. Wouldnt be right if they didnt. Im quite aware of that, she said. Just because its public, I dont have to go, do I? Miss Stephanie Crawford came by. She wore a hat and gloves. Um, um, um, she said. Look at all those folksyoud think William Jennings Bryan was speakin. And where are you going, Stephanie? inquired Miss Maudie. To the Jitney Jungle. Miss Maudie said shed never seen Miss Stephanie go to the Jitney Jungle in a hat in her life. Well, said Miss Stephanie, I thought I might just look in at the courthouse, to see what Atticuss up to. Better be careful he doesnt hand you a subpoena. We asked Miss Maudie to elucidate: she said Miss Stephanie seemed to know so much about the case she might as well be called on to testify. We held off until noon, when Atticus came home to dinner and said theyd spent the morning picking the jury. After dinner, we stopped by for Dill and went to town. It was a gala occasion. There was no room at the public hitching rail for another animal, mules and wagons were parked under every available tree. The courthouse square was covered with picnic parties sitting on newspapers, washing down biscuit and syrup with warm milk from fruit jars. Some people were gnawing on cold chicken and cold fried pork chops. The more affluent chased their food with drugstore Coca-Cola in bulb-shaped soda glasses. Greasy-faced children popped-the-whip through the crowd, and babies lunched at their mothers breasts. In a far corner of the square, the Negroes sat quietly in the sun, dining on sardines, crackers, and the more vivid flavors of Nehi Cola. Mr. Dolphus Raymond sat with them. Jem, said Dill, hes drinkin out of a sack. Mr. Dolphus Raymond seemed to be so doing: two yellow drugstore straws ran from his mouth to the depths of a brown paper bag. Aint ever seen anybody do that, murmured Dill. How does he keep whats in it in it? Jem giggled. Hes got a Co-Cola bottle full of whiskey in there. Thats sos not to upset the ladies. Youll see him sip it all afternoon, hell step out for a while and fill it back up. Whys he sittin with the colored folks? Always does. He likes em bettern he likes us, I reckon. Lives by himself way down near the county line. Hes got a colored woman and all sorts of mixed chillun. Show you some of em if we see em. He doesnt look like trash, said Dill. Hes not, he owns all one side of the riverbank down there, and hes from a real old family to boot. Then why does he do like that? Thats just his way, said Jem. They say he never got over his weddin. He was supposed to marry one of thethe Spencer ladies, I think. They were gonna have a huge weddin, but they didntafter the rehearsal the bride went upstairs and blew her head off. Shotgun. She pulled the trigger with her toes. Did they ever know why? No, said Jem, nobody ever knew quite why but Mr. Dolphus. They said it was because she found out about his colored woman, he reckoned he could keep her and get married too. Hes been sorta drunk ever since. You know, though, hes real good to those chillun Jem, I asked, whats a mixed child? Half white, half colored. Youve seen em, Scout. You know that red-kinky-headed one that delivers for the drugstore. Hes half white. Theyre real sad. Sad, how come? They dont belong anywhere. Colored folks wont have em because theyre half white; white folks wont have em cause theyre colored, so theyre just in-betweens, dont belong anywhere. But Mr. Dolphus, now, they say hes shipped two of his up north. They dont mind em up north. Yonders one of em. A small boy clutching a Negro womans hand walked toward us. He looked all Negro to me: he was rich chocolate with flaring nostrils and beautiful teeth. Sometimes he would skip happily, and the Negro woman tugged his hand to make him stop. Jem waited until they passed us. Thats one of the little ones, he said. How can you tell? asked Dill. He looked black to me. You cant sometimes, not unless you know who they are. But hes half Raymond, all right. But how can youtell? I asked. I told you, Scout, you just hafta know who they are. Well how do you know we aint Negroes? Uncle Jack Finch says we really dont know. He says as far as he can trace back the Finches we aint, but for all he knows we mighta come straight out of Ethiopia durin the Old Testament. Well if we came out durin the Old Testament its too long ago to matter. Thats what I thought, said Jem, but around here once you have a drop of Negro blood, that makes you all black. Hey, look Some invisible signal had made the lunchers on the square rise and scatter bits of newspaper, cellophane, and wrapping paper. Children came to mothers, babies were cradled on hips as men in sweat-stained hats collected their families and herded them through the courthouse doors. In the far corner of the square the Negroes and Mr. Dolphus Raymond stood up and dusted their breeches. There were few women and children among them, which seemed to dispel the holiday mood. They waited patiently at the doors behind the white families. Lets go in, said Dill. Naw, we better wait till they get in, Atticus might not like it if he sees us, said Jem. The Maycomb County courthouse was faintly reminiscent of Arlington in one respect: the concrete pillars supporting its south roof were too heavy for their light burden. The pillars were all that remained standing when the original courthouse burned in 1856. Another courthouse was built around them. It is better to say, built in spite of them. But for the south porch, the Maycomb County courthouse was early Victorian, presenting an unoffensive vista when seen from the north. From the other side, however, Greek revival columns clashed with a big nineteenth-century clock tower housing a rusty unreliable instrument, a view indicating a people determined to preserve every physical scrap of the past. To reach the courtroom, on the second floor, one passed sundry sunless county cubbyholes: the tax assessor, the tax collector, the county clerk, the county solicitor, the circuit clerk, the judge of probate lived in cool dim hutches that smelled of decaying record books mingled with old damp cement and stale urine. It was necessary to turn on the lights in the daytime; there was always a film of dust on the rough floorboards. The inhabitants of these offices were creatures of their environment: little gray-faced men, they seemed untouched by wind or sun. We knew there was a crowd, but we had not bargained for the multitudes in the first- floor hallway. I got separated from Jem and Dill, but made my way toward the wall by thestairwell,knowingJemwouldcomeformeeventually.Ifoundmyselfinthemiddleof the Idlers Club and made myself as unobtrusive as possible. This was a group of white- shirted, khaki-trousered, suspendered old men who had spent their lives doing nothing and passed their twilight days doing same on pine benches under the live oaks on the square. Attentive critics of courthouse business, Atticus said they knew as much law as the Chief Justice, from long years of observation. Normally, they were the courts only spectators, and today they seemed resentful of the interruption of their comfortable routine. When they spoke, their voices sounded casually important. The conversation was about myfather. thinks he knows what hes doing, one said. Oh-h now, I wouldnt say that, said another. Atticus Finchs a deep reader, a mighty deep reader. He reads all right, thats all he does. The club snickered. Lemme tell you somethin now, Billy, a third said, you know the court appointed him to defend this nigger. Yeah, but Atticus aims to defend him. Thats what I dont like about it. This was news, news that put a different light on things: Atticus had to, whether he wanted to or not. I thought it odd that he hadnt said anything to us about itwe could have us
d it many times in defending him and ourselves. He had to, thats why he was doing it, equaled fewer fights and less fussing. But did that explain the towns attitude? The court appointed Atticus to defend him. Atticus aimed to defend him. Thats what they didnt like about it. It was confusing. The Negroes, having waited for the white people to go upstairs, began to come in. Whoa now, just a minute, said a club member, holding up his walking stick. Just dont start up them there stairs yet awhile. The club began its stiff-jointed climb and ran into Dill and Jem on their way down looking for me. They squeezed past and Jem called, Scout, come on, there aint a seat left. Well hafta stand up. Looka there, now. he said irritably, as the black people surged upstairs. The old men ahead of them would take most of the standing room. We were out of luck and it was my fault, Jem informed me. We stood miserably by the wall. Cant you all get in? Reverend Sykes was looking down at us, black hat in hand. Hey, Reverend, said Jem. Naw, Scout here messed us up. Well, lets see what we can do. Reverend Sykes edged his way upstairs. In a few moments he was back. Theres not a seat downstairs. Do you all reckon itll be all right if you all came to the balcony with me? Gosh yes, said Jem. Happily, we sped ahead of Reverend Sykes to the courtroom floor. There, we went up a covered staircase and waited at the door. Reverend Sykes came puffing behind us, and steered us gently through the black people in the balcony. Four Negroes rose and gave us their front-row seats. The Colored balcony ran along three walls of the courtroom like a second-story veranda, and from it we could see everything. The jury sat to the left, under long windows. Sunburned, lanky, they seemed to be all farmers, but this was natural: townfolk rarely sat on juries, they were either struck or excused. One or two of the jury looked vaguely like dressed-up Cunninghams. At this stage they sat straight and alert. The circuit solicitor and another man, Atticus and Tom Robinson sat at tables with their backs to us. There was a brown book and some yellow tablets on the solicitors table; Atticuss was bare. Just inside the railing that divided the spectators from the court, the witnesses sat on cowhide-bottomed chairs. Their backs were to us. Judge Taylor was on the bench, looking like a sleepy old shark, his pilot fish writing rapidly below in front of him. Judge Taylor looked like most judges I had ever seen: amiable, white-haired, slightly ruddy-faced, he was a man who ran his court with an alarming informalityhe sometimes propped his feet up, he often cleaned his fingernails with his pocket knife. In long equity hearings, especially after dinner, he gave the impression of dozing, an impression dispelled forever when a lawyer once deliberately pushed a pile of books to the floor in a desperate effort to wake him up. Without opening his eyes, Judge Taylor murmured, Mr. Whitley, do that again and itll cost you one hundred dollars. He was a man learned in the law, and although he seemed to take his job casually, in reality he kept a firm grip on any proceedings that came before him. Only once was Judge Taylor ever seen at a dead standstill in open court, and the Cunninghams stopped him. Old Sarum, their stamping grounds, was populated by two families separate and apart in the beginning, but unfortunately bearing the same name. The Cunninghams married the Coninghams until the spelling of the names was academic academic until a Cunningham disputed a Coningham over land titles and took to the law. During a controversy of this character, Jeems Cunningham testified that his mother spelled it Cunningham on deeds and things, but she was really a Coningham, she was an uncertain speller, a seldom reader, and was given to looking far away sometimes when she sat on the front gallery in the evening. After nine hours of listening to the eccentricities of Old Sarums inhabitants, Judge Taylor threw the case out of court. When asked upon what grounds, Judge Taylor said, Champertous connivance, and declared he hoped to God the litigants were satisfied by each having had their public say. They were. That was all they had wanted in the first place. Judge Taylor had one interesting habit. He permitted smoking in his courtroom but did not himself indulge: sometimes, if one was lucky, one had the privilege of watching him put a long dry cigar into his mouth and munch it slowly up. Bit by bit the dead cigar would disappear, to reappear some hours later as a flat slick mess, its essence extracted and mingling with Judge Taylors digestive juices. I once asked Atticus how Mrs. Taylor stood to kiss him, but Atticus said they didnt kiss much. The witness stand was to the right of Judge Taylor, and when we got to our seats Mr. Heck Tate was already on it.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch16,"The next morning, Saturday, the whole county begins to file into town to watch Tom Robinson's trial. Jem and Scout run a constant commentary for Dill, explaining the backgrounds and tendencies of everyone that passes. After lunch they head into town themselves to watch the trial. Due to the immense crowd there's no room downstairs but Reverend Sykes, the black preacher from Calpurnia's church, gives them seats in the colored section upstairs. When they get up there and sit down, they see the first witness is Mr. Heck Tate."
"Jem, I said, are those the Ewells sittin down yonder? Hush, said Jem, Mr. Heck Tates testifyin. Mr. Tate had dressed for the occasion. He wore an ordinary business suit, which made him look somehow like every other man: gone were his high boots, lumber jacket, and bullet-studded belt. From that moment he ceased to terrify me. He was sitting forward in the witness chair, his hands clasped between his knees, listening attentively to the circuit solicitor. The solicitor, a Mr. Gilmer, was not well known to us. He was from Abbottsville; we saw him only when court convened, and that rarely, for court was of no special interest to Jem and me. A balding, smooth-faced man, he could have been anywhere between forty and sixty. Although his back was to us, we knew he had a slight cast in one of his eyes which he used to his advantage: he seemed to be looking at a person when he was actually doing nothing of the kind, thus he was hell on juries and witnesses. The jury, thinking themselves under close scrutiny, paid attention; so did the witnesses, thinking likewise. in your own words, Mr. Tate, Mr. Gilmer was saying. Well, said Mr. Tate, touching his glasses and speaking to his knees, I was called Could you say it to the jury, Mr. Tate? Thank you. Who called you? Mr. Tate said, I was fetched by Bobby Mr. Bob Ewell yonder, one night What night, sir? Mr. Tate said, It was the night of November twenty-first. I was just leaving my office to go home when BMr. Ewell came in, very excited he was, and said get out to his house quick, some niggerd raped his girl. Did you go? Certainly. Got in the car and went out as fast as I could. And what did you find? Foundherlyingonthefloorinthemiddleofthefrontroom,oneontherightasyougo in. She was pretty well beat up, but I heaved her to her feet and she washed her face in a bucket in the corner and said she was all right. I asked her who hurt her and she said it was Tom Robinson Judge Taylor, who had been concentrating on his fingernails, looked up as if he were expecting an objection, but Atticus was quiet. asked her if he beat her like that, she said yes he had. Asked her if he took advantage of her and she said yes he did. So I went down to Robinsons house and brought him back. She identified him as the one, so I took him in. Thats all there was to it. Thank you, said Mr. Gilmer. Judge Taylor said, Any questions, Atticus? Yes, said my father. He was sitting behind his table; his chair was skewed to one side, his legs were crossed and one arm was resting on the back of his chair. Did you call a doctor, Sheriff? Did anybody call a doctor? asked Atticus. No sir, said Mr. Tate. Didnt call a doctor? No sir, repeated Mr. Tate. Why not? There was an edge to Atticuss voice. Well I can tell you why I didnt. It wasnt necessary, Mr. Finch. She was mighty banged up. Something sho happened, it was obvious. But you didnt call a doctor? While you were there did anyone send for one, fetch one, carry her to one? No sir Judge Taylor broke in. Hes answered the question three times, Atticus. He didnt call a doctor. Atticus said, I just wanted to make sure, Judge, and the judge smiled. Jems hand, which was resting on the balcony rail, tightened around it. He drew in his breath suddenly. Glancing below, I saw no corresponding reaction, and wondered if Jem was trying to be dramatic. Dill was watching peacefully, and so was Reverend Sykes beside him. What is it? I whispered, and got a terse, Sh-h! Sheriff, Atticus was saying, you say she was mighty banged up. In what way? Well Just describe her injuries, Heck. Well, she was beaten around the head. There was already bruises comin on her arms, and it happened about thirty minutes before How do you know? Mr. Tate grinned. Sorry, thats what they said. Anyway, she was pretty bruised up when I got there, and she had a black eye comin. Which eye? Mr. Tate blinked and ran his hands through his hair. Lets see, he said softly, then he looked at Atticus as if he considered the question childish. Cant you remember? Atticus asked. Mr. Tate pointed to an invisible person five inches in front of him and said, Her left. Wait a minute, Sheriff, said Atticus. Was it her left facing you or her left looking the same way you were? Mr. Tate said, Oh yes, thatd make it her right. It was her right eye, Mr. Finch. I remember now, she was bunged up on that side of her face Mr. Tate blinked again, as if something had suddenly been made plain to him. Then he turned his head and looked around at Tom Robinson. As if by instinct, Tom Robinson raised hishead. Something had been made plain to Atticus also, and it brought him to his feet. Sheriff, please repeat what you said. It was her right eye, I said. No Atticus walked to the court reporters desk and bent down to the furiously scribbling hand. It stopped, flipped back the shorthand pad, and the court reporter said, Mr. Finch. I remember now she was bunged up on that side of the face. Atticus looked up at Mr. Tate. Which side again, Heck? The right side, Mr. Finch, but she had more bruisesyou wanta hear about em? Atticus seemed to be bordering on another question, but he thought better of it and said, Yes, what were her other injuries? As Mr. Tate answered, Atticus turned and looked at Tom Robinson as if to say this was something they hadnt bargained for. her arms were bruised, and she showed me her neck. There were definite finger marks on her gullet All around her throat? At the back of her neck? Id say they were all around, Mr. Finch. You would? Yes sir, she had a small throat, anybody coulda reached around it with Just answer the question yes or no, please, Sheriff, said Atticus dryly, and Mr. Tate fell silent. Atticus sat down and nodded to the circuit solicitor, who shook his head at the judge, who nodded to Mr. Tate, who rose stiffly and stepped down from the witness stand. Below us, heads turned, feet scraped the floor, babies were shifted to shoulders, and a few children scampered out of the courtroom. The Negroes behind us whispered softly among themselves; Dill was asking Reverend Sykes what it was all about, but Reverend Sykes said he didnt know. So far, things were utterly dull: nobody had thundered, there were no arguments between opposing counsel, there was no drama; a grave disappointment to all present, it seemed. Atticus was proceeding amiably, as if he were involved in a title dispute. With his infinite capacity for calming turbulent seas, he could make a rape case as dry as a sermon. Gone was the terror in my mind of stale whiskey and barnyard smells, of sleepy-eyed sullen men, of a husky voice calling in the night, Mr. Finch? They gone? Our nightmare had gone with daylight, everything would come out allright. All the spectators were as relaxed as Judge Taylor, except Jem. His mouth was twisted into a purposeful half-grin, and his eyes happy about, and he said something about corroborating evidence, which made me sure he was showing off. Robert E. Lee Ewell! In answer to the clerks booming voice, a little bantam cock of a man rose and strutted to the stand, the back of his neck reddening at the sound of his name. When he turned around to take the oath, we saw that his face was as red as his neck. We also saw no resemblance to his namesake. A shock of wispy new-washed hair stood up from his forehead; his nose was thin, pointed, and shiny; he had no chin to speak ofit seemed to be part of his crepey neck. so help me God, he crowed. Every town the size of Maycomb had families like the Ewells. No economic fluctuations changed their statuspeople like the Ewells lived as guests of the county in prosperity as well as in the depths of a depression. No truant officers could keep their numerous offspring in school; no public health officer could free them from congenital defects, various worms, and the diseases indigenous to filthysurroundings. Maycombs Ewells lived behind the town garbage dump in what was once a Negro cabin. The cabins plank walls were supplemented with sheets of corrugated iron, its roof shingled with tin cans hammered flat, so only its general shape suggested its original design: square, with four tiny rooms opening onto a shotgun hall, the cabin rested uneasily upon four irregular lumps of limestone. Its windows were merely open spaces in the walls, which in the summertime were covered with greasy strips of cheesecloth to keep out the varmints that feasted on Maycombs refuse. The varmints had a lean time of it, for the Ewells gave the dump a thorough gleaning every day, and the fruits of their industry (those that were not eaten) made the plot of ground around the cabin look like the playhouse of an insane child: what passed for a fence was bits of tree-limbs, broomsticks and tool shafts, all tipped with rusty hammer- heads, snaggle-toothed rake heads, shovels, axes and grubbing hoes, held on with pieces of barbed wire. Enclosed by this barricade was a dirty yard containing the remains of a Model-T Ford (on blocks), a discarded dentists chair, an ancient icebox, plus lesser items: old shoes, worn-out table radios, picture frames, and fruit jars, under which scrawny orange chickens pecked hopefully. One corner of the yard, though, bewildered Maycomb. Against the fence, in a line, were six chipped-enamel slop jars holding brilliant red geraniums, cared for as tenderly as if they belonged to Miss Maudie Atkinson, had Miss Maudie deigned to permit a geranium on her premises. People said they were Mayella Ewells. Nobody was quite sure how many children were on the place. Some people said six, others said nine; there were always several dirty-faced ones at the windows when anyone passed by. Nobody had occasion to pass by except at Christmas, when the churches delivered baskets, and when the mayor of Maycomb asked us to please help the garbage collector by dumping our own trees and trash. Atticus took us with him last Christmas when he complied with the mayors request. A dirt road ran from the highway past the dump, down to a small Negro settlement some five hundred yards beyond the Ewells. It was necessary either to back out to the highway or go the full length of the road and turn around; most people turned around in the Negroes front yards. In the frosty December dusk, their cabins looked neat and snug with pale blue smoke rising from the chimneys and doorways glowing amber from the fires inside. There were delicious smells about: chicken, bacon frying crisp as the twilight air. Jem and I detected squirrel cooking, but it took an old countryman like Atticus to identify possum and rabbit, aromas that vanished when we rode back past the Ewell residence. All the little man on the witness stand had that made him any better than his nearest neighbors was, that if scrubbed with lye soap in very hot water, his skin was white. Mr. Robert Ewell? asked Mr. Gilmer. Thats mname, capn, said the witness. Mr. Gilmers back stiffened a little, and I felt sorry for him. Perhaps Id better explain something now. Ive heard that lawyers children, on seeing their parents in court in the heat of argument, get the wrong idea: they think opposing counsel to be the personal enemies of their parents, they suffer agonies, and are surprised to see them often go out arm-in-arm with their tormenters during the first recess. This was not true of Jem and me. We acquired no traumas from watching our father win or lose. Im sorry that I cant provide any drama in this respect; if I did, it would not be true. We could tell, however, when debate became more acrimonious than professional, but this was from watching lawyers other than our father. I never heard Atticus raise his voice in my life, except to a deaf witness. Mr. Gilmer was doing his job, as Atticus was doing his. Besides, Mr. Ewell was Mr. Gilmers witness, and he had no business being rude to him of all people. Are you the father of Mayella Ewell? was the next question. Well, if I aint I cant do nothing about it now, her mas dead, was the answer. Judge Taylor stirred. He turned slowly in his swivel chair and looked benignly at the witness. Are you the father of Mayella Ewell? he asked, in a way that made the laughter below us stop suddenly. Yes sir, Mr. Ewell said meekly. Judge Taylor went on in tones of good will: This the first time youve ever been in court? I dont recall ever seeing you here. At the witnesss affirmative nod he continued, Well, lets get something straight. There will be no more audibly obscene speculations on any subject from anybody in this courtroom as long as Im sitting here. Do you understand? Mr. Ewell nodded, but I dont think he did. Judge Taylor sighed and said, All right, Mr. Gilmer? Thank you, sir. Mr. Ewell, would you tell us in your own words what happened on the evening of November twenty-first, please? Jem grinned and pushed his hair back. Just-in-your-own words was Mr. Gilmers trademark. We often wondered who elses words Mr. Gilmer was afraid his witness might employ. Well, the night of November twenty-one I was comin in from the woods with a load okindlin and just as I got to the fence I heard Mayella screamin like a stuck hog inside the house Here Judge Taylor glanced sharply at the witness and must have decided his speculations devoid of evil intent, for he subsided sleepily. What time was it, Mr. Ewell? Just fore sundown. Well, I was sayin Mayella was screamin fit to beat Jesus another glance from the bench silenced Mr. Ewell. Yes? She was screaming? said Mr. Gilmer. Mr. Ewell looked confusedly at the judge. Well, Mayella was raisin this holy racket so I dropped mload and run as fast as I could but I run into th fence, but when I got distangled I run up to th window and I seen Mr. Ewells face grew scarlet. He stood up and pointed his finger at Tom Robinson. I seen that black nigger yonder ruttin on my Mayella! So serene was Judge Taylors court, that he had few occasions to use his gavel, but he hammered fully five minutes. Atticus was on his feet at the bench saying something to him, Mr. Heck Tate as first officer of the county stood in the middle aisle quelling the packed courtroom. Behind us, there was an angry muffled groan from the colored people. Reverend Sykes leaned across Dill and me, pulling at Jems elbow. Mr. Jem, he said, you better take Miss Jean Louise home. Mr. Jem, you hear me? Jem turned his head. Scout, go home. Dill, younScout go home. You gotta make me first, I said, remembering Atticuss blessed dictum. Jem scowled furiously at me, then said to Reverend Sykes, I think its okay, Reverend, she doesnt understand it. I was mortally offended. I most certainly do, I cn understand anything you can. Aw hush. She doesnt understand it, Reverend, she aint nine yet. Reverend Sykess black eyes were anxious. Mr. Finch know you all are here? This aint fit for Miss Jean Louise or you boys either. Jem shook his head. He cant see us this far away. Its all right, Reverend. I knew Jem would win, because I knew nothing could make him leave now. Dill and I were safe, for a while: Atticus could see us from where he was, if he looked. As Judge Taylor banged his gavel, Mr. Ewell was sitting smugly in the witness chair, surveying his handiwork. With one phrase he had turned happy picknickers into a sulky, tense, murmuring crowd, being slowly hypnotized by gavel taps lessening in intensity until the only sound in the courtroom was a dim pink-pink-pink: the judge might have been rapping the bench with a pencil. In possession of his court once more, Judge Taylor leaned back in his chair. He looked suddenly weary; his age was showing, and I thought about what Atticus had saidhe and Mrs. Taylor didnt kiss muchhe must have been nearly seventy. There has been a request, Judge Taylor said, that this courtroom be cleared of spectators, or at least of women and children, a request that will be denied for the time being. People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for, and they have the right to subject their children to it, but I can assure you of one thing: you will receive what you see and hear in silence or 
ou will leave this courtroom, but you wont leave it until the whole boiling of you come before me on contempt charges. Mr. Ewell, you will keep your testimony within the confines of Christian English usage, if that is possible. Proceed, Mr. Gilmer. Mr. Ewell reminded me of a deaf-mute. I was sure he had never heard the words Judge Taylor directed at himhis mouth struggled silently with thembut their import registered on his face. Smugness faded from it, replaced by a dogged earnestness that fooled Judge Taylor not at all: as long as Mr. Ewell was on the stand, the judge kept his eyes on him, as if daring him to make a false move. Mr. Gilmer and Atticus exchanged glances. Atticus was sitting down again, his fist rested on his cheek and we could not see his face. Mr. Gilmer looked rather desperate. A question from Judge Taylor made him relax: Mr. Ewell, did you see the defendant having sexual intercourse with your daughter? Yes, I did. The spectators were quiet, but the defendant said something. Atticus whispered to him, and Tom Robinson was silent. You say you were at the window? asked Mr. Gilmer. Yes sir. How far is it from the ground? bout three foot. Did you have a clear view of the room? Yes sir. How did the room look? Well, it was all slung about, like there was a fight. What did you do when you saw the defendant? Well, I run around the house to get in, but he run out the front door just ahead of me. I sawed who he was, all right. I was too distracted about Mayella to run afterim. I run in the house and she was lyin on the floor squallin Then what did you do? Why, I run for Tate quick as I could. I knowed who it was, all right, lived down yonder in that nigger-nest, passed the house every day. Jedge, Ive asked this county for fifteen years to clean out that nest down yonder, theyre dangerous to live around sides devaluin my property Thank you, Mr. Ewell, said Mr. Gilmer hurriedly. The witness made a hasty descent from the stand and ran smack into Atticus, who had risen to question him. Judge Taylor permitted the court to laugh. Just a minute, sir, said Atticus genially. Could I ask you a question or two? Mr. Ewell backed up into the witness chair, settled himself, and regarded Atticus with haughty suspicion, an expression common to Maycomb County witnesses when confronted by opposing counsel. Mr. Ewell, Atticus began, folks were doing a lot of running that night. Lets see, you say you ran to the house, you ran to the window, you ran inside, you ran to Mayella, you ran for Mr. Tate. Did you, during all this running, run for a doctor? Wadnt no need to. I seen what happened. But theres one thing I dont understand, said Atticus. Werent you concerned with Mayellas condition? I most positively was, said Mr. Ewell. I seen who done it. No, I mean her physical condition. Did you not think the nature of her injuries warranted immediate medical attention? What? Didnt you think she should have had a doctor, immediately? The witness said he never thought of it, he had never called a doctor to any of hisn in his life, and if he had it would have cost him five dollars. That all? he asked. Not quite, said Atticus casually. Mr. Ewell, you heard the sheriffs testimony, didnt you? Hows that? You were in the courtroom when Mr. Heck Tate was on the stand, werent you? You heard everything he said, didnt you? Mr. Ewell considered the matter carefully, and seemed to decide that the question was safe. Yes, he said. Do you agree with his description of Mayellas injuries? Hows that? Atticus looked around at Mr. Gilmer and smiled. Mr. Ewell seemed determined not to give the defense the time of day. Mr. Tate testified that her right eye was blackened, that she was beaten around the  Oh yeah, said the witness. I hold with everything Tate said. You do? asked Atticus mildly. I just want to make sure. He went to the court reporter, said something, and the reporter entertained us for some minutes by reading Mr. Tates testimony as if it were stock-market quotations: which eye her left oh yes thatd make it her right it was her right eye Mr. Finch I remember now she was bunged. He flipped the page. Up on that side of the face Sheriff please repeat what you said it was her right eye I said Thank you, Bert, said Atticus. You heard it again, Mr. Ewell. Do you have anything to add to it? Do you agree with the sheriff? I holds with Tate. Her eye was blacked and she was mighty beat up. The little man seemed to have forgotten his previous humiliation from the bench. It was becoming evident that he thought Atticus an easy match. He seemed to grow ruddy again; his chest swelled, and once more he was a red little rooster. I thought hed burst his shirt at Atticuss next question: Mr. Ewell, can you read and write? Mr. Gilmer interrupted. Objection, he said. Cant see what witnesss literacy has to do with the case, irrelevantnimmaterial. Judge Taylor was about to speak but Atticus said, Judge, if youll allow the question plus another one youll soon see. All right, lets see, said Judge Taylor, but make sure we see, Atticus. Overruled. Mr. Gilmer seemed as curious as the rest of us as to what bearing the state of Mr. Ewells education had on the case. Ill repeat the question, said Atticus. Can you read and write? I most positively can. Will you write your name and show us? I most positively will. How do you think I sign my relief checks? Mr. Ewell was endearing himself to his fellow citizens. The whispers and chuckles below us probably had to do with what a card he was. I was becoming nervous. Atticus seemed to know what he was doingbut it seemed to me that hed gone frog-sticking without a light. Never, never, never, on cross- examination ask a witness a question you dont already know the answer to, was a tenet I absorbed with my baby-food. Do it, and youll often get an answer you dont want, an answer that might wreck your case. Atticus was reaching into the inside pocket of his coat. He drew out an envelope, then reached into his vest pocket and unclipped his fountain pen. He moved leisurely, and had turned so that he was in full view of the jury. He unscrewed the fountain-pen cap and placed it gently on his table. He shook the pen a little, then handed it with the envelope to the witness. Would you write your name for us? he asked. Clearly now, so the jury can see you do it. Mr. Ewell wrote on the back of the envelope and looked up complacently to see Judge Taylor staring at him as if he were some fragrant gardenia in full bloom on the witness stand, to see Mr. Gilmer half-sitting, half-standing at his table. The jury was watching him, one man was leaning forward with his hands over the railing. Whats so interestin? he asked. Youre left-handed, Mr. Ewell, said Judge Taylor. Mr. Ewell turned angrily to the judge and said he didnt see what his being left-handed had to do with it, that he was a Christ-fearing man and Atticus Finch was taking advantage of him. Tricking lawyers like Atticus Finch took advantage of him all the time with their tricking ways. He had told them what happened, hed say it again and againwhich he did. Nothing Atticus asked him after that shook his story, that hed looked through the window, then ran the nigger off, then ran for the sheriff. Atticus finally dismissed him. Mr. Gilmer asked him one more question. About your writing with your left hand, are you ambidextrous, Mr. Ewell? I most positively am not, I can use one hand good as the other. One hand good as the other, he added, glaring at the defense table. Jem seemed to be having a quiet fit. He was pounding the balcony rail softly, and once he whispered, Weve got him. I didnt think so: Atticus was trying to show, it seemed to me, that Mr. Ewell could have beaten up Mayella. That much I could follow. If her right eye was blacked and she was beaten mostly on the right side of the face, it would tend to show that a left-handed person did it. Sherlock Holmes and Jem Finch would agree. But Tom Robinson could easily be left-handed, too. Like Mr. Heck Tate, I imagined a person facing me, went through a swift mental pantomime, and concluded that he might have held her with his right hand and pounded her with his left. I looked down at him. His back was to us, but I could see his broad shoulders and bull-thick neck. He could easily have done it. I thought Jem was counting his chickens.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch17,"As Atticus begins to question the sheriff, who was the one that immediately saw Mayella after she was raped, he immediately begins to find holes in his testimony that prove there is no way that Tom Robinson could have beaten and raped the girl, although at this time the jury and crowd don't really know where he's going with his questioning. All that is apparent is that Mayelle's right eye was blackened and that all around her throat was bruised, as if two strong hands had tried to strangle her. The next witness to take the stand is Mayella's father, Bob Ewell, who is poor, uneducated, and downright mean-spirited. As Atticus begins to question him, it becomes finally apparent to Jem where he's going. He suddenly sees that there is no doubt that it was Bob Ewell who beat up Mayelle and then pointed the finger at Tom. Scout still doesn't see it; however, and thinks Jem is counting his chickens before they're hatched. As she looks at the back of Tom Robinson, who is big and strong, she thinks he easily could have hurt Mayella."
"But someone was booming again. Mayella Violet Ewell! A young girl walked to the witness stand. As she raised her hand and swore that the evidence she gave would be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help her God, she seemed somehow fragile-looking, but when she sat facing us in the witness chair she became what she was, a thick-bodied girl accustomed to strenuous labor. In Maycomb County, it was easy to tell when someone bathed regularly, as opposed to yearly lavations: Mr. Ewell had a scalded look; as if an overnight soaking had deprived him of protective layers of dirt, his skin appeared to be sensitive to the elements. Mayella looked as if she tried to keep clean, and I was reminded of the row of red geraniums in the Ewell yard. Mr. Gilmer asked Mayella to tell the jury in her own words what happened on the evening of November twenty-first of last year, just in her own words, please. Mayella sat silently. Where were you at dusk on that evening? began Mr. Gilmer patiently. On the porch. Whichporch? Aint but one, the front porch. What were you doing on the porch? Nothin. Judge Taylor said, Just tell us what happened. You can do that, cant you? Mayella stared at him and burst into tears. She covered her mouth with her handsand sobbed. Judge Taylor let her cry for a while, then he said, Thats enough now. Dont be fraid of anybody here, as long as you tell the truth. All this is strange to you, I know, but youve nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to fear. What are you scaredof? Mayella said something behind her hands. What was that? asked the judge. Him, she sobbed, pointing at Atticus. Mr. Finch? She nodded vigorously, saying, Dont want him doin me like he done Papa, tryin to make him out lefthanded Judge Taylor scratched his thick white hair. It was plain that he had never been confronted with a problem of this kind. How old are you? he asked. Nineteen-and-a-half, Mayella said. Judge Taylor cleared his throat and tried unsuccessfully to speak in soothing tones. Mr. Finch has no idea of scaring you, he growled, and if he did, Im here to stop him. Thats one thing Im sitting up here for. Now youre a big girl, so you just sit up straight and tell thetell us what happened to you. You can do that, cant you? I whispered to Jem, Has she got good sense? Jem was squinting down at the witness stand. Cant tell yet, he said. Shes got enough sense to get the judge sorry for her, but she might be justoh, I dont know. Mollified, Mayella gave Atticus a final terrified glance and said to Mr. Gilmer, Well sir, I was on the porch andand he came along and, you see, there was this old chiffarobe in the yard Papad brought in to chop up for kindlinPapa told me to do it while he was off in the woods but I wadnt feelin strong enough then, so he came by- Who is he? Mayella pointed to Tom Robinson. Ill have to ask you to be more specific, please, said Mr. Gilmer. The reporter cant put down gestures very well. Thatn yonder, she said. Robinson. Then what happened? I said come here, nigger, and bust up this chiffarobe for me, I gotta nickel for you. He coulda done it easy enough, he could. So he come in the yard an I went in the house to get him the nickel and I turned around an fore I knew it he was on me. Just run up behind me, he did. He got me round the neck, cussin me an sayin dirtI foughtnhollered, but he had me round the neck. He hit me agin anagin Mr. Gilmer waited for Mayella to collect herself: she had twisted her handkerchief into a sweaty rope; when she opened it to wipe her face it was a mass of creases from her hot hands. She waited for Mr. Gilmer to ask another question, but when he didnt, she said, -he chunked me on the floor an choked men took advantage ofme. Did you scream? asked Mr. Gilmer. Did you scream and fight back? Reckon I did, hollered for all I was worth, kicked and hollered loud as I could. Then what happened? I dont remember too good, but next thing I knew Papa was in the room astanding over me hollerin who done it, who done it? Then I sorta fainted an the next thing I knew Mr. Tate was pullin me up offa the floor and leadin me to the water bucket. Apparently Mayellas recital had given her confidence, but it was not her fathers brash kind: there was something stealthy about hers, like a steady-eyed cat with a twitchy tail. You say you fought him off as hard as you could? Fought him tooth and nail? asked Mr. Gilmer. I positively did, Mayella echoed her father. You are positive that he took full advantage of you? Mayellas face contorted, and I was afraid that she would cry again. Instead, she said, He done what he was after. Mr. Gilmer called attention to the hot day by wiping his head with his hand. Thats all for the time being, he said pleasantly, but you stay there. I expect big bad Mr. Finch has some questions to ask you. State will not prejudice the witness against counsel for the defense, murmured Judge Taylor primly, at least not at this time. Atticus got up grinning but instead of walking to the witness stand, he opened his coat and hooked his thumbs in his vest, then he walked slowly across the room to the windows. He looked out, but didnt seem especially interested in what he saw, then he turned and strolled back to the witness stand. From long years of experience, I could tell he was trying to come to a decision about something. Miss Mayella, he said, smiling, I wont try to scare you for a while, not yet. Lets just get acquainted. How old are you? Said I was nineteen, said it to the judge yonder. Mayella jerked her head resentfully at the bench. So you did, so you did, maam. Youll have to bear with me, Miss Mayella, Im getting along and cant remember as well as I used to. I might ask you things youve already said before, but youll give me an answer, wont you? Good. I could see nothing in Mayellas expression to justify Atticuss assumption that he had secured her wholehearted cooperation. She was looking at him furiously. Wont answer a word you say long as you keep on mockin me, she said. Maam? asked Atticus, startled. Longs you keep on makin fun ome. Judge Taylor said, Mr. Finch is not making fun of you. Whats the matter with you? Mayella looked from under lowered eyelids at Atticus, but she said to the judge: Longs he keeps on callin me maam an sayin Miss Mayella. I dont hafta take his sass, I aint called upon to take it. Atticus resumed his stroll to the windows and let Judge Taylor handle this one. Judge Taylor was not the kind of figure that ever evoked pity, but I did feel a pang for him as he tried to explain. Thats just Mr. Finchs way, he told Mayella. Weve done business in this court for years and years, and Mr. Finch is always courteous to everybody. Hes not trying to mock you, hes trying to be polite. Thats just his way. The judge leaned back. Atticus, lets get on with these proceedings, and let the record show that the witness has not been sassed, her views to the contrary. I wondered if anybody had ever called her maam, or Miss Mayella in her life; probably not, as she took offense to routine courtesy. What on earth was her life like? I soon found out. You say youre nineteen, Atticus resumed. How many sisters and brothers have you? He walked from the windows back to the stand. Sebm, she said, and I wondered if they were all like the specimen I had seen the first day I started to school. You the eldest? The oldest? Yes. How long has your mother been dead? Dont knowlong time. Did you ever go to school? Readnwrite good as Papa yonder. Mayella sounded like a Mr. Jingle in a book I had been reading. How long did you go to school? Two yearthree yeardunno. Slowly but surely I began to see the pattern of Atticuss questions: from questions that Mr. Gilmer did not deem sufficiently irrelevant or immaterial to object to, Atticus was quietly building up before the jury a picture of the Ewells home life. The jury learned the following things: their relief check was far from enough to feed the family, and there was strong suspicion that Papa drank it up anywayhe sometimes went off in the swamp for days and came home sick; the weather was seldom cold enough to require shoes, but when it was, you could make dandy ones from strips of old tires; the family hauled its water in buckets from a spring that ran out at one end of the dumpthey kept the surrounding area clear of trashand it was everybody for himself as far as keeping clean went: if you wanted to wash you hauled your own water; the younger children had perpetual colds and suffered from chronic ground-itch; there was a lady who came around sometimes and asked Mayella why she didnt stay in schoolshe wrote down the answer; with two members of the family reading and writing, there was no need for the rest of them to learnPapa needed them at home. Miss Mayella, said Atticus, in spite of himself, a nineteen-year-old girl like you must have friends. Who are your friends? The witness frowned as if puzzled. Friends? Yes, dont you know anyone near your age, or older, or younger? Boys and girls? Just ordinary friends? Mayellas hostility, which had subsided to grudging neutrality, flared again. You makin fun ome agin, Mr. Finch? Atticus let her question answer his. Do you love your father, Miss Mayella? was his next. Love him, whatcha mean? I mean, is he good to you, is he easy to get along with? He does tollable, cept when Except when? Mayella looked at her father, who was sitting with his chair tipped against the railing. He sat up straight and waited for her to answer. Except when nothin, said Mayella. I said he does tollable. Mr. Ewell leaned backagain. Except when hes drinking? asked Atticus so gently that Mayella nodded. Does he ever go afteryou? How you mean? When hesriled, has he ever beaten you? Mayella looked around, down at the court reporter, up at the judge. Answer the question, Miss Mayella, said Judge Taylor. My paws never touched a hair omy head in my life, she declared firmly. He never touched me. Atticuss glasses had slipped a little, and he pushed them up on his nose. Weve had a good visit, Miss Mayella, and now I guess wed better get to the case. You say you asked Tom Robinson to come chop up awhat was it? A chiffarobe, a old dresser full of drawers on one side. Was Tom Robinson well known to you? Whaddya mean? I mean did you know who he was, where he lived? Mayella nodded. I knowed who he was, he passed the house every day. Was this the first time you asked him to come inside the fence? Mayella jumped slightly at the question. Atticus was making his slow pilgrimage to the windows, as he had been doing: he would ask a question, then look out, waiting for an answer. He did not see her involuntary jump, but it seemed to me that he knew she had moved. He turned around and raised his eyebrows. Was he began again. Yes it was. Didnt you ever ask him to come inside the fence before? She was prepared now. I did not, I certainly did not. One did nots enough, said Atticus serenely. You never asked him to do odd jobs for you before? I mighta, conceded Mayella. There was several niggers around. Can you remember any other occasions? No. All right, now to what happened. You said Tom Robinson was behind you in the room when you turned around, that right? Yes. You said he got you around the neck cussing and saying dirtis that right? ts right. Atticuss memory had suddenly become accurate. You say he caught me and choked me and took advantage of meis that right? Thats what I said. Do you remember him beating you about the face? The witness hesitated. You seem sure enough that he choked you. All this time you were fighting back, remember? You kicked and hollered as loud as you could. Do you remember him beating you about the face? Mayella was silent. She seemed to be trying to get something clear to herself. I thought for a moment she was doing Mr. Heck Tates and my trick of pretending there was a person in front of us. She glanced at Mr. Gilmer. Its an easy question, Miss Mayella, so Ill try again. Do you remember him beating you about the face? Atticuss voice had lost its comfortableness; he was speaking in his arid, detached professional voice. Do you remember him beating you about the face? No, I dont recollect if he hit me. I mean yes I do, he hit me. Was your last sentence your answer? Huh? Yes, he hitI just dont remember, I just dont remember it all happened so quick. Judge Taylor looked sternly at Mayella. Dont you cry, young woman he began, but Atticus said, Let her cry if she wants to, Judge. Weve got all the time in the world. Mayella sniffed wrathfully and looked at Atticus. Ill answer any question you gotget me up here an mock me, will you? Ill answer any question you got Thats fine, said Atticus. Therere only a few more. Miss Mayella, not to be tedious, youve testified that the defendant hit you, grabbed you around the neck, choked you, and took advantage of you. I want you to be sure you have the right man. Will you identify the man who raped you? I will, thats him right yonder. Atticus turned to the defendant. Tom, stand up. Let Miss Mayella have a good long look at you. Is this the man, Miss Mayella? Tom Robinsons powerful shoulders rippled under his thin shirt. He rose to his feet and stood with his right hand on the back of his chair. He looked oddly off balance, but it was not from the way he was standing. His left arm was fully twelve inches shorter than his right, and hung dead at his side. It ended in a small shriveled hand, and from as far away as the balcony I could see that it was no use tohim. Scout, breathed Jem. Scout, look! Reverend, hes crippled! Reverend Sykes leaned across me and whispered to Jem. He got it caught in a cotton gin, caught it in Mr. Dolphus Raymonds cotton gin when he was a boy like to bled to death tore all the muscles loose from his bones Atticus said, Is this the man who raped you? It most certainly is. Atticuss next question was one word long. How? Mayella was raging. I dont know how he done it, but he done itI said it all happened so fast I Now lets consider this calmly began Atticus, but Mr. Gilmer interrupted with an objection: he was not irrelevant or immaterial, but Atticus was browbeating the witness. Judge Taylor laughed outright. Oh sit down, Horace, hes doing nothing of the sort. If anything, the witnesss browbeating Atticus. Judge Taylor was the only person in the courtroom who laughed. Even the babies were still, and I suddenly wondered if they had been smothered at their mothers breasts. Now, said Atticus, Miss Mayella, youve testified that the defendant choked and beat youyou didnt say that he sneaked up behind you and knocked you cold, but you turned around and there he was Atticus was back behind his table, and he emphasized his words by tapping his knuckles on it. do you wish to reconsider any of your testimony? You want me to say something that didnt happen? No maam, I want you to say something that did happen. Tell us once more, please, what happened? I toldja what happened. You testified that you turned around and there he was. He choked you then? Yes. Then he released your throat and hit you? I said he did. He blacked your left eye with his right fist? I ducked and itit glanced, thats what it did. I ducked and it glanced off. Mayella had finally seen the light. Youre becoming suddenly clear on this point. A while ago you couldnt remember too well, could you? I said he hit me. All right. He choked you, he hit you, then he raped you, that right? It most certainly is. Youre a strong girl, what were you doing all the time, just standing there? I toldja I hollerednkickednfought Atticus reached up and took off his glasses, turned his good right eye to the witness, and rained questions on her. Judge Taylor said, One question at a time, Atticus. Give the witness a chance to answer. All right, why didnt you run? I tried Tried to
 What kept you from it? Ihe slung me down. Thats what he did, he slung me downn got on top of me. You were screaming all this time? I certainly was. Then why didnt the other children hear you? Where were they? At the dump? Where were they? No answer. Why didnt your screams make them come running? The dumps closer than the woods, isnt it? No answer. Or didnt you scream until you saw your father in the window? You didnt think to scream until then, did you? Noanswer. Did you scream first at your father instead of at Tom Robinson? Was that it? No answer. Who beat you up? Tom Robinson or your father? No answer. What did your father see in the window, the crime of rape or the best defense to it? Why dont you tell the truth, child, didnt Bob Ewell beat you up? When Atticus turned away from Mayella he looked like his stomach hurt, but Mayellas face was a mixture of terror and fury. Atticus sat down wearily and polished his glasses with his handkerchief. Suddenly Mayella became articulate. I got somethin to say, she said. Atticus raised his head. Do you want to tell us what happened? But she did not hear the compassion in his invitation. I got somethin to say an then I aint gonna say no more. That nigger yonder took advantage of me an if you fine fancy gentlemen dont wanta do nothin about it then youre all yellow stinkin cowards, stinkin cowards, the lot of you. Your fancy airs dont come to nothinyour maamin and Miss Mayellerin dont come to nothin, Mr. Finch Then she burst into real tears. Her shoulders shook with angry sobs. She was as good as her word. She answered no more questions, even when Mr. Gilmer tried to get her back on the track. I guess if she hadnt been so poor and ignorant, Judge Taylor would have put her under the jail for the contempt she had shown everybody in the courtroom. Somehow, Atticus had hit her hard in a way that was not clear to me, but it gave him no pleasure to do so. He sat with his head down, and I never saw anybody glare at anyone with the hatred Mayella showed when she left the stand and walked by Atticuss table. When Mr. Gilmer told Judge Taylor that the state rested, Judge Taylor said, Its time we all did. Well take ten minutes. Atticus and Mr. Gilmer met in front of the bench and whispered, then they left the courtroom by a door behind the witness stand, which was a signal for us all to stretch. I discovered that I had been sitting on the edge of the long bench, and I was somewhat numb. Jem got up and yawned, Dill did likewise, and Reverend Sykes wiped his face on his hat. The temperature was an easy ninety, he said. Mr. Braxton Underwood, who had been sitting quietly in a chair reserved for the Press, soaking up testimony with his sponge of a brain, allowed his bitter eyes to rove over the colored balcony, and they met mine. He gave a snort and looked away. Jem, I said, Mr. Underwoods seen us. Thats okay. He wont tell Atticus, hell just put it on the social side of theTribune. Jem turned back to Dill, explaining, I suppose, the finer points of the trial to him, but I wondered what they were. There had been no lengthy debates between Atticus and Mr. Gilmer on any points; Mr. Gilmer seemed to be prosecuting almost reluctantly; witnesses had been led by the nose as asses are, with few objections. But Atticus had once told us that in Judge Taylors court any lawyer who was a strict constructionist on evidence usually wound up receiving strict instructions from the bench. He distilled this for me to mean that Judge Taylor might look lazy and operate in his sleep, but he was seldom reversed, and that was the proof of the pudding. Atticus said he was a good judge. Presently Judge Taylor returned and climbed into his swivel chair. He took a cigar from his vest pocket and examined it thoughtfully. I punched Dill. Having passed the judges inspection, the cigar suffered a vicious bite. We come down sometimes to watch him, I explained. Its gonna take him the rest of the afternoon, now. You watch. Unaware of public scrutiny from above, Judge Taylor disposed of the severed end by propelling it expertly to his lips and saying, Fhluck! He hit a spittoon so squarely we could hear it slosh. Bet he was hell with a spitball, murmured Dill. As a rule, a recess meant a general exodus, but today people werent moving. Even the Idlers who had failed to shame younger men from their seats had remained standing along the walls. I guess Mr. Heck Tate had reserved the county toilet for court officials. Atticus and Mr. Gilmer returned, and Judge Taylor looked at his watch. Its gettin on to four, he said, which was intriguing, as the courthouse clock must have struck the hour at least twice. I had not heard it or felt its vibrations. Shall we try to wind up this afternoon? asked Judge Taylor. How bout it, Atticus? I think we can, said Atticus. How many witnesses you got? One. Well, call him.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch18,"Mayella is the next to take the stand, and as Atticus questions her he begins to poke holes in her testimony as well. Finally he asks Tom Robinson to stand up so Mayella can identify him, and everyone sees that his left arm is fully 12 inches shorter than his right, and is therefore crippled and unusable. Scout finally sees that there is no way he could have choked Mayella and blacked out her right eye. It's a physical impossibility. Atticus then begins to ask her if it was really her father that beat her up but she refuses to say, and she refuses to say another word after she accuses Tom Robinson one more time."
"Thomas Robinson reached around, ran his fingers under his left arm and lifted it. He guided his arm to the Bible and his rubber-like left hand sought contact with the black binding. As he raised his right hand, the useless one slipped off the Bible and hit the clerks table. He was trying again when Judge Taylor growled, Thatll do, Tom. Tom took the oath and stepped into the witness chair. Atticus very quickly induced him to tell us: Tom was twenty-five years of age; he was married with three children; he had been in trouble with the law before: he once received thirty days for disorderly conduct. It must have been disorderly, said Atticus. What did it consist of? Got in a fight with another man, he tried to cut me. Did he succeed? Yes suh, a little, not enough to hurt. You see, I Tom moved his left shoulder. Yes, said Atticus. You were both convicted? Yes suh, I had to serve cause I couldnt pay the fine. Other fellow paid hisn. Dill leaned across me and asked Jem what Atticus was doing. Jem said Atticus was showing the jury that Tom had nothing to hide. Were you acquainted with Mayella Violet Ewell? asked Atticus. Yes suh, I had to pass her place goin to and from the field every day. Whose field? I picks for Mr. Link Deas. Were you picking cotton in November? No suh, I works in his yard fall an wintertime. I works pretty steady for him all year round, hes got a lot of pecan treesn things. You say you had to pass the Ewell place to get to and from work. Is there any other way to go? No suh, nones I know of. Tom, did she ever speak to you? Why, yes suh, Id tip mhat when Id go by, and one day she asked me to come inside the fence and bust up a chiffarobe for her. When did she ask you to chop up thethe chiffarobe? Mr. Finch, it was way last spring. I remember it because it was choppin time and I had my hoe with me. I said I didnt have nothin but this hoe, but she said she had a hatchet. She give me the hatchet and I broke up the chiffarobe. She said, I reckon Ill hafta give you a nickel, wont I? an I said, No maam, there aint no charge. Then I went home. Mr. Finch, that was way last spring, way over a year ago. Did you ever go on the place again? Yes suh. When? Well, I went lots of times. Judge Taylor instinctively reached for his gavel, but let his hand fall. The murmur below us died without his help. Under what circumstances? Please, suh? Why did you go inside the fence lots of times? Tom Robinsons forehead relaxed. Shed call me in, suh. Seemed like every time I passed by yonder shed have some little somethin for me to dochoppin kindlin, totin water for her. She watered them red flowers every day Were you paid for your services? No suh, not after she offered me a nickel the first time. I was glad to do it, Mr. Ewell didnt seem to help her none, and neither did the chillun, and I knowed she didnt have no nickels to spare. Where were the other children? They was always around, all over the place. Theyd watch me work, some of em, some of emd set in the window. Would Miss Mayella talk to you? Yes sir, she talked to me. As Tom Robinson gave his testimony, it came to me that Mayella Ewell must have been the loneliest person in the world. She was even lonelier than Boo Radley, who had not been out of the house in twenty-five years. When Atticus asked had she any friends, she seemed not to know what he meant, then she thought he was making fun of her. She was as sad, I thought, as what Jem called a mixed child: white people wouldnt have anything to do with her because she lived among pigs; Negroes wouldnt have anything to do with her because she was white. She couldnt live like Mr. Dolphus Raymond, who preferred the company of Negroes, because she didnt own a riverbank and she wasnt from a fine old family. Nobody said, Thats just their way, about the Ewells. Maycomb gave them Christmas baskets, welfare money, and the back of its hand. Tom Robinson was probably the only person who was ever decent to her. But she said he took advantage of her, and when she stood up she looked at him as if he were dirt beneath herfeet. Did you ever, Atticus interrupted my meditations, at any time, go on the Ewell propertydid you ever set foot on the Ewell property without an express invitation from one of them? No suh, Mr. Finch, I never did. I wouldnt do that, suh. Atticus sometimes said that one way to tell whether a witness was lying or telling the truth was to listen rather than watch: I applied his testTom denied it three times in one breath, but quietly, with no hint of whining in his voice, and I found myself believing him in spite of his protesting too much. He seemed to be a respectable Negro, and a respectable Negro would never go up into somebodys yard of his own volition. Tom, what happened to you on the evening of November twenty-first of last year? Below us, the spectators drew a collective breath and leaned forward. Behind us, the Negroes did the same. Tom was a black-velvet Negro, not shiny, but soft black velvet. The whites of his eyes shone in his face, and when he spoke we saw flashes of his teeth. If he had been whole, he would have been a fine specimen of a man. Mr. Finch, he said, I was goin home as usual that evenin, an when I passed the Ewell place Miss Mayella were on the porch, like she said she were. It seemed real quiet like, an I didnt quite know why. I was studyin why, just passin by, when she says for me to come there and help her a minute. Well, I went inside the fence an looked around for some kindlin to work on, but I didnt see none, and she says, Naw, I got somethin for you to do in the house. Th old doors off its hinges an falls comin on pretty fast. I said you got a screwdriver, Miss Mayella? She said she sho had. Well, I went up the steps an she motioned me to come inside, and I went in the front room an looked at the door. I said Miss Mayella, this door look all right. I pulled it backn forth and those hinges was all right. Then she shet the door in my face. Mr. Finch, I was wonderin why it was so quiet like, an it come to me that there werent a chile on the place, not a one of em, and I said Miss Mayella, where thechillun? Toms black velvet skin had begun to shine, and he ran his hand over his face. I say where the chillun? he continued, an she saysshe was laughin, sort ofshe says they all gone to town to get ice creams. She says, took me a slap year to save sebm nickels, but I done it. They all gone to town. Toms discomfort was not from the humidity. What did you say then, Tom? asked Atticus. I said somethin like, why Miss Mayella, thats right smart oyou to treat em. An she said, You think so? I dont think she understood what I was thinkinI meant it was smart of her to save like that, an nice of her to treat em. I understand you, Tom. Go on, said Atticus. Well, I said I best be goin, I couldnt do nothin for her, an she says oh yes I could, an I ask her what, and she says to just step on that chair yonder an git that box down from on top of the chiffarobe. Not the same chiffarobe you busted up? asked Atticus. The witness smiled. Naw suh, another one. Most as tall as the room. So I done what she told me, an I was just reachin when the next thing I knows sheshed grabbed me round the legs, grabbed me round th legs, Mr. Finch. She scared me so bad I hopped down an turned the chair overthat was the only thing, only furniture, sturbed in that room, Mr. Finch, when I left it. I swear fore God. What happened after you turned the chair over? Tom Robinson had come to a dead stop. He glanced at Atticus, then at the jury, then at Mr. Underwood sitting across the room. Tom, youre sworn to tell the whole truth. Will you tell it? Tom ran his hand nervously over his mouth. What happened after that? Answer the question, said Judge Taylor. One-third of his cigar had vanished. Mr. Finch, I got down offa that chair an turned around an she sorta jumped on me. Jumped on you? Violently? No suh, sheshe hugged me. She hugged me round the waist. This time Judge Taylors gavel came down with a bang, and as it did the overhead lights went on in the courtroom. Darkness had not come, but the afternoon sun had left the windows. Judge Taylor quickly restored order. Then what did she do? The witness swallowed hard. She reached up an kissed me side of th face. She says she never kissed a grown man before an she might as well kiss a nigger. She says what her papa do to her dont count. She says, Kiss me back, nigger. I say Miss Mayella lemme outa here an tried to run but she got her back to the door an Ida had to push her. I didnt wanta harm her, Mr. Finch, an I say lemme pass, but just when I say it Mr. Ewell yonder hollered through thwindow. What did he say? Tom Robinson swallowed again, and his eyes widened. Somethin not fittin to say not fittin for these folksn chillun to hear What did he say, Tom? Youmusttell the jury what he said. Tom Robinson shut his eyes tight. He says you goddamn whore, Ill kill ya. Then what happened? Mr. Finch, I was runnin so fast I didnt know what happened. Tom, did you rape Mayella Ewell? I did not,suh. Did you harm her in any way? I did not,suh. Did you resist her advances? Mr. Finch, I tried. I tried to thout bein ugly to her. I didnt wanta be ugly, I didnt wanta push her or nothin. It occurred to me that in their own way, Tom Robinsons manners were as good as Atticuss. Until my father explained it to me later, I did not understand the subtlety of Toms predicament: he would not have dared strike a white woman under any circumstances and expect to live long, so he took the first opportunity to runa sure sign of guilt. Tom, go back once more to Mr. Ewell, said Atticus. Did he say anything to you? Not anything, suh. He mighta said somethin, but I werent there Thatll do, Atticus cut in sharply. What you did hear, who was he talking to? Mr. Finch, he were talkin and lookin at Miss Mayella. Then you ran? I sho did, suh. Why did you run? I was scared, suh. Why were you scared? Mr. Finch, if you was a nigger like me, youd be scared, too. Atticus sat down. Mr. Gilmer was making his way to the witness stand, but before he got there Mr. Link Deas rose from the audience and announced: I just want the whole lot of you to know one thing right now. That boys worked for me eight years an I aint had a speck otrouble outa him. Not a speck. Shut your mouth, sir! Judge Taylor was wide awake and roaring. He was also pink in the face. His speech was miraculously unimpaired by his cigar. Link Deas, he yelled, if you have anything you want to say you can say it under oath and at the proper time, but until then you get out of this room, you hear me? Get out of this room, sir, you hear me? Ill be damned if Ill listen to this caseagain! Judge Taylor looked daggers at Atticus, as if daring him to speak, but Atticus had ducked his head and was laughing into his lap. I remembered something he had said about Judge Taylors ex cathedra remarks sometimes exceeding his duty, but that few lawyers ever did anything about them. I looked at Jem, but Jem shook his head. It aint like one of the jurymen got up and started talking, he said. I think itd be different then. Mr. Link was just disturbin the peace or something. Judge Taylor told the reporter to expunge anything he happened to have written down after Mr. Finch if you were a nigger like me youd be scared too, and told the jury to disregard the interruption. He looked suspiciously down the middle aisle and waited, I suppose, for Mr. Link Deas to effect total departure. Then he said, Go ahead, Mr. Gilmer. You were given thirty days once for disorderly conduct, Robinson? asked Mr. Gilmer. Yes suh. Whatd the nigger look like when you got through with him? He beat me, Mr. Gilmer. Yes, but you were convicted, werent you? Atticus raised his head. It was a misdemeanor and its in the record, Judge. I thought he sounded tired. Witnessll answer, though, said Judge Taylor, just as wearily. Yes suh, I got thirty days. I knew that Mr. Gilmer would sincerely tell the jury that anyone who was convicted of disorderly conduct could easily have had it in his heart to take advantage of Mayella Ewell, that was the only reason he cared. Reasons like that helped. Robinson, youre pretty good at busting up chiffarobes and kindling with one hand, arent you? Yes, suh, I reckon so. Strong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor? I never done that, suh. But you are strong enough to? I reckon so, suh. Had your eye on her a long time, hadnt you, boy? No suh, I never looked at her. Then you were mighty polite to do all that chopping and hauling for her, werent you, boy? I was just tryin to help her out, suh. That was mighty generous of you, you had chores at home after your regular work, didnt you? Yes suh. Why didnt you do them instead of Miss Ewells? I done em both, suh. You must have been pretty busy. Why? Why what, suh? Why were you so anxious to do that womans chores? Tom Robinson hesitated, searching for an answer. Looked like she didnt have nobody to help her, like I says With Mr. Ewell and seven children on the place, boy? Well, I says it looked like they never help her none You did all this chopping and work from sheer goodness, boy? Tried to help her, I says. Mr. Gilmer smiled grimly at the jury. Youre a mighty good fellow, it seemsdid all this for not one penny? Yes, suh. I felt right sorry for her, she seemed to try moren the rest of em You felt sorry forher, you feltsorryfor he? Mr. Gilmer seemed ready to rise to the ceiling. The witness realized his mistake and shifted uncomfortably in the chair. But the damage was done. Below us, nobody liked Tom Robinsons answer. Mr. Gilmer paused a long time to let it sink in. Now you went by the house as usual, last November twenty-first, he said, and she asked you to come in and bust up a chiffarobe? No suh. Do you deny that you went by the house? No suhshe said she had somethin for me to do inside the house She says she asked you to bust up a chiffarobe, is that right? No suh, it aint. Then you say shes lying, boy? Atticus was on his feet, but Tom Robinson didnt need him. I dont say shes lyin, Mr. Gilmer, I say shes mistaken in her mind. To the next ten questions, as Mr. Gilmer reviewed Mayellas version of events, the witnesss steady answer was that she was mistaken in her mind. Didnt Mr. Ewell run you off the place, boy? No suh, I dont think he did. Dont think, what do you mean? I mean I didnt stay long enough for him to run me off. Youre very candid about this, why did you run so fast? I says I was scared, suh. If you had a clear conscience, why were you scared? Like I says before, it werent safe for any nigger to be in afix like that. But you werent in a fixyou testified that you were resisting Miss Ewell. Were you so scared that shed hurt you, you ran, a big buck like you? No suh, Is scared Id be in court, just like I am now. Scared of arrest, scared youd have to face up to what you did? No suh, scared Id hafta face up to what I didnt do. Are you being impudent to me, boy? No suh, I didnt go to be. This was as much as I heard of Mr. Gilmers cross-examination, because Jem made me take Dill out. For some reason Dill had started crying and couldnt stop; quietly at first, then his sobs were heard by several people in the balcony. Jem said if I didnt go with him hed make me, and Reverend Sykes said Id better go, so I went. Dill had seemed to be all right that day, nothing wrong with him, but I guessed he hadnt fully recovered from running away. Aint you feeling good? I asked, when we reached the bottom of the stairs. Dill tried to pull himself together as we ran down the south steps. Mr. Link Deas was a lonely figure on the top step. Anything happenin, Scout? he asked as we went by. No sir, I answered over my shoulder. Dill here, hes sick. Come on out under th
 trees, I said. Heat got you, I expect. We chose the fattest live oak and we sat under it. It was just him I couldnt stand, Dill said. Who, Tom? That old Mr. Gilmer doin him thataway, talking so hateful to him Dill, thats his job. Why, if we didnt have prosecutorswell, we couldnt have defense attorneys, I reckon. Dill exhaled patiently. I know all that, Scout. It was the way he said it made me sick, plain sick. Hes supposed to act that way, Dill, he was cross He didnt act that way when Dill, those were his own witnesses. Well, Mr. Finch didnt act that way to Mayella and old man Ewell when he cross- examined them. The way that man called him boy all the time an sneered at him, an looked around at the jury every time he answered Well, Dill, after all hes just a Negro. I dont care one speck. It aint right, somehow it aint right to do em that way. Hasnt anybody got any business talkin like thatit just makes me sick. Thats just Mr. Gilmers way, Dill, he does em all that way. Youve never seen him get goodn down on one yet. Why, whenwell, today Mr. Gilmer seemed to me like he wasnt half trying. They do em all that way, most lawyers, I mean. Mr. Finch doesnt. Hes not an example, Dill, hes I was trying to grope in my memory for a sharp phrase of Miss Maudie Atkinsons. I had it: Hes the same in the courtroom as he is on the public streets. Thats not what I mean, said Dill. I know what you mean, boy, said a voice behind us. We thought it came from the tree-trunk, but it belonged to Mr. Dolphus Raymond. He peered around the trunk at us. You arent thin-hided, it just makes you sick, doesnt it?",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch19,"The next and last witness is Tom Robinson himself. Tom tells the jury that he went into Mayella's yard lots of times to help her with little chores, and that she was always asking for his help. She once offered to pay him, but Tom declined the invitation. Since that, Tom willingly executed Mayella's chores free of charge. When he begins talking about the night of the rape he tells everyone that Mayella invited him in to do a chore and then started coming on to him, trying to kiss him, and it was her father that saw what she was trying to do through the window. Tom tried to resist Mayella without hurting her, and as soon as he could get away he took off running. He is soft-spoken and polite. But he makes the mistake of telling Mr. Gilmore that the reason he helped Mayella is because he felt sorry for her. And in those times, a black man feeling sorry for a white woman or even saying it may as well be a crime. During the cross examination by Mr. Gilmore Dill begins crying uncontrollably, so Scout takes him outside for some fresh air. Dill cannot get over how cruel Mr. Gilmore (the prosecutor) is to Tom Robinson, and another man is outside the courthouse and knows exactly why Dill is so upset."
"Come on round here, son, I got something thatll settle your stomach. As Mr. Dolphus Raymond was an evil man I accepted his invitation reluctantly, but I followed Dill. Somehow, I didnt think Atticus would like it if we became friendly with Mr. Raymond, and I knew Aunt Alexandra wouldnt. Here, he said, offering Dill his paper sack with straws in it. Take a good sip, itll quieten you. Dill sucked on the straws, smiled, and pulled at length. Hee hee, said Mr. Raymond, evidently taking delight in corrupting a child. Dill, you watch out, now, I warned. Dill released the straws and grinned. Scout, its nothing but Coca-Cola. Mr. Raymond sat up against the tree-trunk. He had been lying on the grass. You little folks wont tell on me now, will you? Itd ruin my reputation if you did. You mean all you drink in that sacks Coca-Cola? Just plain Coca-Cola? Yes maam, Mr. Raymond nodded. I liked his smell: it was of leather,horses, cottonseed. He wore the only English riding boots I had ever seen. Thats all I drink, most of the time. Then you just pretend youre half? I beg your pardon, sir, I caught myself. I didnt mean to be Mr. Raymond chuckled, not at all offended, and I tried to frame a discreet question: Why do you do like you do? Whoh yes, you mean why do I pretend? Well, its very simple, he said. Some folks dontlike the way I live. Now I could say the hell with em, I dont care if they dont like it. I do say I dont care if they dont like it, right enoughbut I dont say the hell with em, see? Dill and I said, No sir. I try to give em a reason, you see. It helps folks if they can latch onto a reason. When I come to town, which is seldom, if I weave a little and drink out of this sack, folks can say Dolphus Raymonds in the clutches of whiskeythats why he wont change his ways. He cant help himself, thats why he lives the way he does. That aint honest, Mr. Raymond, making yourself out baddern you are already It aint honest but its mighty helpful to folks. Secretly, Miss Finch, Im not much ofa drinker, but you see they could never, never understand that I live like I do because thats the way I want to live. I had a feeling that I shouldnt be here listening to this sinful man who had mixed children and didnt care who knew it, but he was fascinating. I had never encountered a being who deliberately perpetrated fraud against himself. But why had he entrusted us with his deepest secret? I asked him why. Because youre children and you can understand it, he said, and because I heard that one He jerked his head at Dill: Things havent caught up with that ones instinct yet. Let him get a little older and he wont get sick and cry. Maybe thingsll strike him as being not quite right, say, but he wont cry, not when he gets a few years on him. Cry about what, Mr. Raymond? Dills maleness was beginning to assert itself. Cry about the simple hell people give other peoplewithout even thinking. Cry about the hell white people give colored folks, without even stopping to think that theyre people, too. Atticus says cheatin a colored man is ten times worse than cheatin a white man, I muttered. Says its the worst thing you can do. Mr. Raymond said, I dont reckon itsMiss Jean Louise, you dont know your pas not a run-of-the-mill man, itll take a few years for that to sink inyou havent seen enough of the world yet. You havent even seen this town, but all you gotta do is step back inside the courthouse. Which reminded me that we were missing nearly all of Mr. Gilmers cross-examination. I looked at the sun, and it was dropping fast behind the store-tops on the west side of the square. Between two fires, I could not decide which I wanted to jump into: Mr. Raymond or the 5th Judicial Circuit Court. Cmon, Dill, I said. You all right, now? Yeah. Glad tve metcha, Mr. Raymond, and thanks for the drink, it was mighty settlin. We raced back to the courthouse, up the steps, up two flights of stairs, and edged our way along the balcony rail. Reverend Sykes had saved our seats. The courtroom was still, and again I wondered where the babies were. Judge Taylors cigar was a brown speck in the center of his mouth; Mr. Gilmer was writing on one of the yellow pads on his table, trying to outdo the court reporter, whose hand was jerking rapidly. Shoot, I muttered, we missed it. Atticus was halfway through his speech to the jury. He had evidently pulled some papers from his briefcase that rested beside his chair, because they were on his table. Tom Robinson was toying with them. absence of any corroborative evidence, this man was indicted on a capital charge and is now on trial for his life I punched Jem. How longs he been at it? Hes just gone over the evidence, Jem whispered, and were gonna win, Scout. I dont see how we cant. Hes been at it bout five minutes. He made it as plain and easy aswell, as Ida explained it to you. You couldve understood it, even. Did Mr. Gilmer? Sh-h. Nothing new, just the usual. Hush now. We looked down again. Atticus was speaking easily, with the kind of detachment he used when he dictated a letter. He walked slowly up and down in front of the jury, and the jury seemed to be attentive: their heads were up, and they followed Atticuss route with what seemed to be appreciation. I guess it was because Atticus wasnt a thunderer. Atticus paused, then he did something he didnt ordinarily do. He unhitched his watch and chain and placed them on the table, saying, With the courts permission Judge Taylor nodded, and then Atticus did something I never saw him do before or since, in public or in private: he unbuttoned his vest, unbuttoned his collar, loosened his tie, and took off his coat. He never loosened a scrap of his clothing until he undressed at bedtime, and to Jem and me, this was the equivalent of him standing before us stark naked. We exchanged horrified glances. Atticus put his hands in his pockets, and as he returned to the jury, I saw his gold collar button and the tips of his pen and pencil winking in the light. Gentlemen, he said. Jem and I again looked at each other: Atticus might have said, Scout. His voice had lost its aridity, its detachment, and he was talking to the jury as if they were folks on the post office corner. Gentlemen, he was saying, I shall be brief, but I would like to use my remaining time with you to remind you that this case is not a difficult one, it requires no minute sifting of complicated facts, but it does require you to be sure beyond all reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendant. To begin with, this case should never have come to trial. This case is as simple as black and white. The state has not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect that the crime Tom Robinson is charged with ever took place. It has relied instead upon the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into serious question on cross-examination, but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant. The defendant is not guilty, but somebody in this courtroom is. I have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state, but my pity does not extend so far as to her putting a mans life at stake, which she has done in an effort to get rid of her own guilt. I say guilt, gentlemen, because it was guilt that motivated her. She has committed no crime, she has merely broken a rigid and time-honored code of our society, a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as unfit to live with. She is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance, but I cannot pity her: she is white. She knew full well the enormity of her offense, but because her desires were stronger than the code she was breaking, she persisted in breaking it. She persisted, and her subsequent reaction is something that all of us have known at one time or another. She did something every child has doneshe tried to put the evidence of her offense away from her. But in this case she was no child hiding stolen contraband: she struck out at her victimof necessity she must put him away from herhe must be removed from her presence, from this world. She must destroy the evidence of her offense. What was the evidence of her offense? Tom Robinson, a human being. She must put Tom Robinson away from her. Tom Robinson was her daily reminder of what she did. What did she do? She tempted a Negro. She was white, and she tempted a Negro. She did something that in our society is unspeakable: she kissed a black man. Not an old Uncle, but a strong young Negro man. No code mattered to her before she broke it, but it came crashing down on her afterwards. Her father saw it, and the defendant has testified as to his remarks. What did her father do? We dont know, but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that Mayella Ewell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with his left. We do know in part what Mr. Ewell did: he did what any God-fearing, persevering, respectable white man would do under the circumstanceshe swore out a warrant, no doubt signing it with his left hand, and Tom Robinson now sits before you, having taken the oath with the only good hand he possesseshis right hand. And so a quiet, respectable, humble Negro who had the unmitigated temerity to feel sorry for a white woman has had to put his word against two white peoples. I need not remind you of their appearance and conduct on the standyou saw them for yourselves. The witnesses for the state, with the exception of the sheriff of Maycomb County, have presented themselves to you gentlemen, to this court, in the cynical confidence that their testimony would not be doubted, confident that you gentlemen would go along with them on the assumptionthe evil assumptionthatallNegroes lie, thatallNegroes are basically immoral beings, thatallNegro men are not to be trusted around our women, an assumption one associates with minds of their caliber. Which, gentlemen, we know is in itself a lie as black as Tom Robinsons skin, a lie I do not have to point out to you. You know the truth, and the truth is this: some Negroes lie, some Negroes are immoral, some Negro men are not to be trusted around women black or white. But this is a truth that applies to the human race and to no particular race of men. There is not a person in this courtroom who has never told a lie, who has never done an immoral thing, and there is no man living who has never looked upon a woman without desire. Atticus paused and took out his handkerchief. Then he took off his glasses and wiped them, and we saw another first: we had never seen him sweathe was one of those men whose faces never perspired, but now it was shining tan. One more thing, gentlemen, before I quit. Thomas Jefferson once said that all men are created equal, a phrase that the Yankees and the distaff side of the Executive branch in Washington are fond of hurling at us. There is a tendency in this year of grace, 1935, for certain people to use this phrase out of context, to satisfy all conditions. The most ridiculous example I can think of is that the people who run public education promote the stupid and idle along with the industriousbecause all men are created equal, educators will gravely tell you, the children left behind suffer terrible feelings of inferiority. We know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believesome people are smarter than others, some people have more opportunity because theyre born with it, some men make more money than others, some ladies make better cakes than otherssome people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men. But there is one way in this country in which all men are created equalthere is one human institution that makes a pauper the equal of a Rockefeller, the stupid man the equal of an Einstein, and the ignorant man the equal of any college president. That institution, gentlemen, is a court. It can be the Supreme Court of the United States or the humblest J.P. court in the land, or this honorable court which you serve. Our courts have their faults, as does any human institution, but in this country our courts are the great levelers, and in our courts all men are created equal. Im no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts and in the jury system that is no ideal to me, it is a living, working reality. Gentlemen, a court is no better than each man of you sitting before me on this jury. A court is only as sound as its jury, and a jury is only as sound as the men who make it up. I am confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the evidence you have heard, come to a decision, and restore this defendant to his family. In the name of God, do your duty. Atticuss voice had dropped, and as he turned away from the jury he said something I did not catch. He said it more to himself than to the court. I punched Jem. Whatd he say? In the name of God, believe him, I think thats what he said. Dill suddenly reached over me and tugged at Jem. Looka yonder! We followed his finger with sinking hearts. Calpurnia was making her way up the middle aisle, walking straight toward Atticus.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch20,"The man is Mr. Dolphus Raymond, a local character who is ostracized because he married a black woman. To tone down the talk about him around the town he pretends to be a drunk, but it is really Coca Cola that is in the paper sack he carries around. He tells Dill that people can be very cruel sometimes and that it makes him sick too. Scout knows she shouldn't be out talking to this sinful man, but she finds him nice and fascinating. When they get back inside the courthouse they find Atticus in the middle of his closing statement, and Jem is convinced they're going to win the case since Tom Robinson could not have physically done what Mayella is accusing him of."
"She stopped shyly at the railing and waited to get Judge Taylors attention. She was in a fresh apron and she carried an envelope in her hand. Judge Taylor saw her and said, Its Calpurnia, isnt it? Yes sir, she said. Could I just pass this note to Mr. Finch, please sir? It hasnt got anything to do withwith the trial. Judge Taylor nodded and Atticus took the envelope from Calpurnia. He opened it, read its contents and said, Judge, Ithis note is from my sister. She says my children are missing, havent turned up since noon I could you I know where they are, Atticus. Mr. Underwood spoke up. Theyre right up yonder in the colored balconybeen there since precisely one-eighteen P.M. Ourfatherturnedaroundandlookedup.Jem,comedownfromthere,hecalled. Then he said something to the Judge we didnt hear. We climbed across Reverend Sykes and made our way to thestaircase. Atticus and Calpurnia met us downstairs. Calpurnia looked peeved, but Atticus looked exhausted. Jem was jumping in excitement. Weve won, havent we? Ive no idea, said Atticus shortly. Youve been here all afternoon? Go home with Calpurnia and get your supperand stay home. Aw, Atticus, let us come back, pleaded Jem. Please let us hear the verdict,please sir. The jury might be out and back in a minute, we dont know but we could tell Atticus was relenting. Well, youve heard it all, so you might as well hear the rest. Tell you what, you all can come back when youve eaten your suppereat slowly, now, you wont miss anything importantand if the jurys still out, you can wait with us. But I expect itll be over before you getback. You think theyll acquit him that fast? asked Jem. Atticus opened his mouth to answer, but shut it and left us. I prayed that Reverend Sykes would save our seats for us, but stopped praying when I remembered that people got up and left in droves when the jury was outtonight, theyd overrun the drugstore, the O.K. Caf and the hotel, that is, unless they had brought their suppers too. Calpurnia marched us home: skin every one of you alive, the very idea, you children listenin to all that! Mister Jem, dont you know bettern to take your little sister to that trial? Miss Alexandrall absolutely have a stroke of paralysis when she findsout! Aint fittin for children to hear The streetlights were on, and we glimpsed Calpurnias indignant profile as we passed beneath them. Mister Jem, I thought you was gettin some kinda head on your shouldersthe very idea, shes your little sister! The veryidea, sir! You oughta be perfectly ashamed of yourselfaint you got any sense at all? I was exhilarated. So many things had happened so fast I felt it would take years to sort them out, and now here was Calpurnia giving her precious Jem down the country what new marvels would the evening bring? Jem was chuckling. Dont you want to hear about it, Cal? Hush your mouth, sir! When you oughta be hangin your head in shame you go along laughin Calpurnia revived a series of rusty threats that moved Jem to little remorse, and she sailed up the front steps with her classic, If Mr. Finch dont wear you out, I willget in that house, sir! Jem went in grinning, and Calpurnia nodded tacit consent to having Dill in to supper. You all call Miss Rachel right now and tell her where you are, she told him. Shes run distracted lookin for youyou watch out she dont ship you back to Meridian first thing in the mornin. Aunt Alexandra met us and nearly fainted when Calpurnia told her where we were. I guess it hurt her when we told her Atticus said we could go back, because she didnt say a word during supper. She just rearranged food on her plate, looking at it sadly while Calpurnia served Jem, Dill and me with a vengeance. Calpurnia poured milk, dished out potato salad and ham, muttering, shamed of yourselves, in varying degrees of intensity. Now you all eat slow, was her final command. Reverend Sykes had saved our places. We were surprised to find that we had been gone nearly an hour, and were equally surprised to find the courtroom exactly as we had left it, with minor changes: the jury box was empty, the defendant was gone; Judge Taylor had been gone, but he reappeared as we were seating ourselves. Nobodys moved, hardly, said Jem. They moved around some when the jury went out, said Reverend Sykes. The menfolk down there got the womenfolk their suppers, and they fed their babies. How long have they been out? asked Jem. bout thirty minutes. Mr. Finch and Mr. Gilmer did some more talkin, and Judge Taylor charged the jury. How was he? asked Jem. What say? Oh, he did right well. I aint complainin one bithe was mighty fair- minded. He sorta said if you believe this, then youll have to return one verdict, but if you believe this, youll have to return another one. I thought he was leanin a little to our side Reverend Sykes scratched his head. Jem smiled. Hes not supposed to lean, Reverend, but dont fret, weve won it, he said wisely. Dont see how any jury could convict on what we heard Now dont you be so confident, Mr. Jem, I aint ever seen any jury decide in favor of a colored man over a white man But Jem took exception to Reverend Sykes, and we were subjected to a lengthy review of the evidence with Jems ideas on the law regarding rape: it wasnt rape if she let you, but she had to be eighteenin Alabama, that isand Mayella was nineteen. Apparently you had to kick and holler, you had to be overpowered and stomped on, preferably knocked stone cold. If you were under eighteen, you didnt have to go through all this. Mr. Jem, Reverend Sykes demurred, this aint a polite thing for little ladies to hear Aw, she doesnt know what were talkin about, said Jem. Scout, this is too old for you, aint it? It most certainly is not, I know every word youre saying. Perhaps I was too convincing, because Jem hushed and never discussed the subject again. What time is it, Reverend? he asked. Gettin on toward eight. I looked down and saw Atticus strolling around with his hands in his pockets: he made a tour of the windows, then walked by the railing over to the jury box. He looked in it, inspected Judge Taylor on his throne, then went back to where he started. I caught his eye and waved to him. He acknowledged my salute with a nod, and resumed his tour. Mr. Gilmer was standing at the windows talking to Mr. Underwood. Bert, the court reporter, was chain-smoking: he sat back with his feet on the table. But the officers of the court, the ones presentAtticus, Mr. Gilmer, Judge Taylor sound asleep, and Bert, were the only ones whose behavior seemed normal. I had never seen a packed courtroom so still. Sometimes a baby would cry out fretfully, and a child would scurry out, but the grown people sat as if they were in church. In the balcony, the Negroes sat and stood around us with biblical patience. The old courthouse clock suffered its preliminary strain and struck the hour, eight deafening bongs that shook our bones. When it bonged eleven times I was past feeling: tired from fighting sleep, I allowed myself a short nap against Reverend Sykess comfortable arm and shoulder. I jerked awake and made an honest effort to remain so, by looking down and concentrating on the heads below: there were sixteen bald ones, fourteen men that could pass for redheads, forty heads varying between brown and black, andI remembered something Jem had once explained to me when he went through a brief period of psychical research: he said if enough peoplea stadium full, maybewere to concentrate on one thing, such as setting a tree afire in the woods, that the tree would ignite of its own accord. I toyed with the idea of asking everyone below to concentrate on setting Tom Robinson free, but thought if they were as tired as I, it wouldnt work. Dill was sound asleep, his head on Jems shoulder, and Jem was quiet. Aint it a long time? I asked him. Sure is, Scout, he said happily. Well, from the way you put it, itd just take five minutes. Jem raised his eyebrows. There are things you dont understand, he said, and I was too weary to argue. But I must have been reasonably awake, or I would not have received the impression that was creeping into me. It was not unlike one I had last winter, and I shivered, though the night was hot. The feeling grew until the atmosphere in the courtroom was exactly the same as a cold February morning, when the mockingbirds were still, and the carpenters had stopped hammering on Miss Maudies new house, and every wood door in the neighborhood was shut as tight as the doors of the Radley Place. A deserted, waiting, empty street, and the courtroom was packed with people. A steaming summer night was no different from a winter morning. Mr. Heck Tate, who had entered the courtroom and was talking to Atticus, might have been wearing his high boots and lumber jacket. Atticus had stopped his tranquil journey and had put his foot onto the bottom rung of a chair; as he listened to what Mr. Tate was saying, he ran his hand slowly up and down his thigh. I expected Mr. Tate to say any minute, Take him, Mr. Finch But Mr. Tate said, This court will come to order, in a voice that rang with authority, and the heads below us jerked up. Mr. Tate left the room and returned with Tom Robinson. He steered Tom to his place beside Atticus, and stood there. Judge Taylor hadrousedhimselftosuddenalertnessandwassittingupstraight,lookingattheempty jury box. What happened after that had a dreamlike quality: in a dream I saw the jury return, moving like underwater swimmers, and Judge Taylors voice came from far away and was tiny. I saw something only a lawyers child could be expected to see, could be expected to watch for, and it was like watching Atticus walk into the street, raise a rifle to his shoulder and pull the trigger, but watching all the time knowing that the gun was empty. A jury never looks at a defendant it has convicted, and when this jury came in, not one of them looked at Tom Robinson. The foreman handed a piece of paper to Mr. Tate who handed it to the clerk who handed it to the judge I shut my eyes. Judge Taylor was polling the jury: Guilty guilty guilty guilty I peeked at Jem: his hands were white from gripping the balcony rail, and his shoulders jerked as if each guilty was a separate stab between them. Judge Taylor was saying something. His gavel was in his fist, but he wasnt using it. Dimly, I saw Atticus pushing papers from the table into his briefcase. He snapped it shut, went to the court reporter and said something, nodded to Mr. Gilmer, and then went to Tom Robinson and whispered something to him. Atticus put his hand on Toms shoulder as he whispered. Atticus took his coat off the back of his chair and pulled it over his shoulder. Then he left the courtroom, but not by his usual exit. He must have wanted to go home the short way, because he walked quickly down the middle aisle toward the south exit. I followed the top of his head as he made his way to the door. He did not look up. Someone was punching me, but I was reluctant to take my eyes from the people below us, and from the image of Atticuss lonely walk down the aisle. Miss Jean Louise? I looked around. They were standing. All around us and in the balcony on the opposite wall, the Negroes were getting to their feet. Reverend Sykess voice was as distant as Judge Taylors: Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your fathers passin.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch21,"When they go home that evening for dinner they can hardly wait to go back to the courthouse because they don't want to miss the verdict. They wolf down their supper and race back. The jury stays out a long time, till almost midnight, deciding on a verdict, and Scout falls asleep waiting to hear. In total the jurors were out deciding almost nine hours. Finally they come back with a verdict: guilty."
"It was Jems turn to cry. His face was streaked with angry tears as we made our way through the cheerful crowd. It aint right, he muttered, all the way to the corner of the square where we found Atticus waiting. Atticus was standing under the street light looking as though nothing had happened: his vest was buttoned, his collar and tie were neatly in place, his watch-chain glistened, he was his impassive self again. It aint right, Atticus, said Jem. No son, its not right. We walked home. Aunt Alexandra was waiting up. She was in her dressing gown, and I could have sworn she had on her corset underneath it. Im sorry, brother, she murmured. Having never heard her call Atticus brother before, I stole a glance at Jem, but he was not listening. He would look up at Atticus, then down at the floor, and I wondered if he thought Atticus somehow responsible for Tom Robinsons conviction. Is he all right? Aunty asked, indicating Jem. Hell be so presently, said Atticus. It was a little too strong for him. Our father sighed. Im going to bed, he said. If I dont wake up in the morning, dont call me. I didnt think it wise in the first place to let them This is their home, sister, said Atticus. Weve made it this way for them, they might as well learn to cope with it. But they dont have to go to the courthouse and wallow in it Its just as much Maycomb County as missionary teas. Atticus Aunt Alexandras eyes were anxious. You are the last person I thought would turn bitter over this. Im not bitter, just tired. Im going to bed. Atticus said Jem bleakly. He turned in the doorway. What, son? How could they do it, how could they? I dont know, but they did it. Theyve done it before and they did it tonight and theyll do it again and when they do itseems that only children weep. Good night. But things are always better in the morning. Atticus rose at his usual ungodly hour and was in the livingroom behind theMobile Registerwhen we stumbled in. Jems morning face posed the question his sleepy lips struggled to ask. Its not time to worry yet, Atticus reassured him, as we went to the diningroom. Were not through yet. Therell be an appeal, you can count on that. Gracious alive, Cal, whats all this? He was staring at his breakfast plate. Calpurnia said, Tom Robinsons daddy sent you along this chicken this morning. I fixed it. You tell him Im proud to get itbet they dont have chicken for breakfast at the White House. What are these? Rolls, said Calpurnia. Estelle down at the hotel sent em. Atticus looked up at her, puzzled, and she said, You better step out here and see whats in the kitchen, Mr. Finch. We followed him. The kitchen table was loaded with enough food to bury the family: hunks of salt pork, tomatoes, beans, even scuppernongs. Atticus grinned when he found a jar of pickled pigs knuckles. Reckon Auntyll let me eat these in the diningroom? Calpurnia said, This was all round the back steps when I got here this morning. Theythey preciate what you did, Mr. Finch. Theythey arent oversteppin themselves, are they? Atticuss eyes filled with tears. He did not speak for a moment. Tell them Im very grateful, he said. Tell themtell them they must never do this again. Times are too hard He left the kitchen, went in the diningroom and excused himself to Aunt Alexandra, put on his hat and went to town. We heard Dills step in the hall, so Calpurnia left Atticuss uneaten breakfast on the table. Between rabbit-bites Dill told us of Miss Rachels reaction to last night, which was: if a man like Atticus Finch wants to butt his head against a stone wall its his head. Ida got her told, growled Dill, gnawing a chicken leg, but she didnt look much like tellin this morning. Said she was up half the night wonderin where I was, said sheda had the sheriff after me but he was at the hearing. Dill, youve got to stop goin off without tellin her, said Jem. It just aggravates her. Dill sighed patiently. I told her till I was blue in the face where I was goinshes just seein too many snakes in the closet. Bet that woman drinks a pint for breakfast every morningknow she drinks two glasses full. Seen her. Dont talk like that, Dill, said Aunt Alexandra. Its not becoming to a child. Its cynical. I aint cynical, Miss Alexandra. Tellin the truths not cynical, is it? The way you tell it, it is. Jems eyes flashed at her, but he said to Dill, Lets go. You can take that runner with you. When we went to the front porch, Miss Stephanie Crawford was busy telling it to Miss Maudie Atkinson and Mr. Avery. They looked around at us and went on talking. Jem made a feral noise in his throat. I wished for a weapon. I hate grown folks lookin at you, said Dill. Makes you feel like youve done something. Miss Maudie yelled for Jem Finch to come there. Jem groaned and heaved himself up from the swing. Well go with you, Dill said. Miss Stephanies nose quivered with curiosity. She wanted to know who all gave us permission to go to courtshe didnt see us but it was all over town this morning that we were in the Colored balcony. Did Atticus put us up there as a sort of? Wasnt it right close up there with all those? Did Scout understand all the? Didnt it make us mad to see our daddybeat? Hush, Stephanie. Miss Maudies diction was deadly. Ive not got all the morning to pass on the porchJem Finch, I called to find out if you and your colleagues can eat some cake. Got up at five to make it, so you better say yes. Excuse us, Stephanie. Good morning, Mr. Avery. There was a big cake and two little ones on Miss Maudies kitchen table. There should have been three little ones. It was not like Miss Maudie to forget Dill, and we must have shown it. But we understood when she cut from the big cake and gave the slice to Jem. As we ate, we sensed that this was Miss Maudies way of saying that as far as she was concerned, nothing had changed. She sat quietly in a kitchen chair, watching us. Suddenly she spoke: Dont fret, Jem. Things are never as bad as they seem. Indoors, when Miss Maudie wanted to say something lengthy she spread her fingers on her knees and settled her bridgework. This she did, and we waited. I simply want to tell you that there are some men in this world who were born to do our unpleasant jobs for us. Your fathers one of them. Oh, said Jem. Well. Dont you oh well me, sir, Miss Maudie replied, recognizing Jems fatalistic noises, you are not old enough to appreciate what I said. Jem was staring at his half-eaten cake. Its like bein a caterpillar in a cocoon, thats what it is, he said. Like somethin asleep wrapped up in a warm place. I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least thats what they seemed like. Were the safest folks in the world, said Miss Maudie. Were so rarely called on to be Christians, but when we are, weve got men like Atticus to go for us. Jem grinned ruefully. Wish the rest of the county thought that. Youd be surprised how many of us do. Who? Jems voice rose. Who in this town did one thing to help Tom Robinson, just who? His colored friends for one thing, and people like us. People like Judge Taylor. People like Mr. Heck Tate. Stop eating and start thinking, Jem. Did it ever strike you that Judge Taylor naming Atticus to defend that boy was no accident? That Judge Taylor might have had his reasons for naming him? This was a thought. Court-appointed defenses were usually given to Maxwell Green, Maycombs latest addition to the bar, who needed the experience. Maxwell Green should have had Tom Robinsons case. You think about that, Miss Maudie was saying. It was no accident. I was sittin there on the porch last night, waiting. I waited and waited to see you all come down the sidewalk, and as I waited I thought, Atticus Finch wont win, he cant win, but hes the only man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long in a case like that. And I thought to myself, well, were making a stepits just a baby-step, but its a step. ts all right to talk like thatcant any Christian judges an lawyers make up for heathen juries, Jem muttered. Soons I get grown Thats something youll have to take up with your father, Miss Maudie said. We went down Miss Maudies cool new steps into the sunshine and found Mr. Avery and Miss Stephanie Crawford still at it. They had moved down the sidewalk and were standing in front of Miss Stephanies house. Miss Rachel was walking toward them. I think Ill be a clown when I get grown, said Dill. Jem and I stopped in our tracks. Yes sir, a clown, he said. There aint one thing in this world I can do about folks except laugh, so Im gonna join the circus and laugh my head off. You got it backwards, Dill, said Jem. Clowns are sad, its folks that laugh at them. Well Im gonna be a new kind of clown. Im gonna stand in the middle of the ring and laugh at the folks. Just looka yonder, he pointed. Every one of em oughta be ridin broomsticks. Aunt Rachel already does. Miss Stephanie and Miss Rachel were waving wildly at us, in a way that did not give the lie to Dills observation. Oh gosh, breathed Jem. I reckon itd be ugly not to see em. Something was wrong. Mr. Avery was red in the face from a sneezing spell and nearly blew us off the sidewalk when we came up. Miss Stephanie was trembling with excitement, and Miss Rachel caught Dills shoulder. You get on in the back yard and stay there, she said. Theres danger acomin. s matter? I asked. Aint you heard yet? Its all over town At that moment Aunt Alexandra came to the door and called us, but she was too late. It was Miss Stephanies pleasure to tell us: this morning Mr. Bob Ewell stopped Atticus on the post office corner, spat in his face, and told him hed get him if it took the rest of his life.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch22,"Jem starts to cry, and cannot believe the jury would convict Tom when it was so obvious he hadn't raped Mayella. He and Scout are both in shock. The next morning the Finches all surprised at the amount of food that was left on the back porch from black people in the community, mostly from Calpurnia's neighborhood, to tell Atticus ""thank you"" for defending Tom Robinson, in spite of the verdict. The children have a conversation with Miss Maudie who tells them that it wasn't just Atticus trying to help Tom Robinson. They Judge was trying, Mr. Heck Tate was trying, there were lots of people behind the scene trying. They might of lost the case, she says, but only Atticus could have kept a jury out so long deciding. In her mind, it's a baby step towards equality."
"I wish Bob Ewell wouldnt chew tobacco, was all Atticus said about it. According to Miss Stephanie Crawford, however, Atticus was leaving the post office when Mr. Ewell approached him, cursed him, spat on him, and threatened to kill him. Miss Stephanie (who, by the time she had told it twice was there and had seen it all passing by from the Jitney Jungle, she was)Miss Stephanie said Atticus didnt bat an eye, just took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and stood there and let Mr. Ewell call him names wild horses could not bring her to repeat. Mr. Ewell was a veteran of an obscure war; that plus Atticuss peaceful reaction probably prompted him to inquire, Too proud to fight, you nigger-lovin bastard? Miss Stephanie said Atticus said, No, too old, put his hands in his pockets and strolled on. Miss Stephanie said you had to hand it to Atticus Finch, he could be right dry sometimes. Jem and I didnt think it entertaining. After all, though, I said, he was the deadest shot in the county one time. He could You know he wouldnt carry a gun, Scout. He aint even got one said Jem. You know he didnt even have one down at the jail that night. He told me havin a gun arounds an invitation to somebody to shoot you. This is different, I said. We can ask him to borrow one. We did, and he said, Nonsense. Dill was of the opinion that an appeal to Atticuss better nature might work: after all, we would starve if Mr. Ewell killed him, besides be raised exclusively by Aunt Alexandra, and we all knew the first thing shed do before Atticus was under the ground good would be to fire Calpurnia. Jem said it might work if I cried and flung a fit, being young and a girl. That didnt work either. But when he noticed us dragging around the neighborhood, not eating, taking little interest in our normal pursuits, Atticus discovered how deeply frightened we were. He tempted Jem with a new football magazine one night; when he saw Jem flip the pages and toss it aside, he said, Whats bothering you, son? Jem came to the point: Mr. Ewell. What has happened? Nothings happened. Were scared for you, and we think you oughta do something about him. Atticus smiled wryly. Do what? Put him under a peace bond? When a man says hes gonna get you, looks like he means it. He meant it when he said it, said Atticus. Jem, see if you can stand in Bob Ewells shoes a minute. I destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he had any to begin with. The man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind always does. So if spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell one extra beating, thats something Ill gladly take. He had to take it out on somebody and Id rather it be me than that houseful of children out there. Youunderstand? Jem nodded. Aunt Alexandra entered the room as Atticus was saying, We dont have anything to fear from Bob Ewell, he got it all out of his system that morning. I wouldnt be so sure of that, Atticus, she said. His kindd do anything to pay off a grudge. You know how those people are. What on earth could Ewell do to me, sister? Something furtive, Aunt Alexandra said. You may count on that. Nobody has much chance to be furtive in Maycomb, Atticus answered. After that, we were not afraid. Summer was melting away, and we made the most of it. Atticus assured us that nothing would happen to Tom Robinson until the higher court reviewed his case, and that Tom had a good chance of going free, or at least of having a new trial. He was at Enfield Prison Farm, seventy miles away in Chester County. I asked Atticus if Toms wife and children were allowed to visit him, but Atticus said no. If he loses his appeal, I asked one evening, whatll happen to him? Hell go to the chair, said Atticus, unless the Governor commutes his sentence. Not time to worry yet, Scout. Weve got a good chance. Jem was sprawled on the sofa readingPopular Mechanics. He looked up. It aint right. He didnt kill anybody even if he was guilty. He didnt take anybodys life. You know rapes a capital offense in Alabama, said Atticus. Yessir, but the jury didnt have to give him deathif they wanted to they couldve gave him twenty years. Given, said Atticus. Tom Robinsons a colored man, Jem. No jury in this part of the worlds going to say, We think youre guilty, but not very, on a charge like that. It was either a straight acquittal or nothing. Jem was shaking his head. I know its not right, but I cant figure out whats wrong maybe rape shouldnt be a capital offense Atticus dropped his newspaper beside his chair. He said he didnt have any quarrel with the rape statute, none what ever, but he did have deep misgivings when the state asked for and the jury gave a death penalty on purely circumstantial evidence. He glanced at me, saw I was listening, and made it easier. I mean, before a man is sentenced to death for murder, say, there should be one or two eye-witnesses. Some one should be able to say, Yes, I was there and saw him pull the trigger. But lots of folks have been hunghangedon circumstantial evidence, said Jem. I know, and lots of em probably deserved it, toobut in the absence of eye- witnesses theres always a doubt, some times only the shadow of a doubt. The law says reasonable doubt, but I think a defendants entitled to the shadow of a doubt. Theres always the possibility, no matter how improbable, that hes innocent. Then it all goes back to the jury, then. We oughta do away with juries. Jem was adamant. Atticus tried hard not to smile but couldnt help it. Youre rather hard on us, son. I think maybe there might be a better way. Change the law. Change it so that only judges have the power of fixing the penalty in capital cases. Then go up to Montgomery and change the law. Youd be surprised how hard thatd be. I wont live to see the law changed, and if you live to see it youll be an old man. This was not good enough for Jem. No sir, they oughta do away with juries. He wasnt guilty in the first place and they said he was. If you had been on that jury, son, and eleven other boys like you, Tom would be a free man, said Atticus. So far nothing in your life has interfered with your reasoning process. Those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life, Toms jury, but you saw something come between them and reason. You saw the same thing that night in front of the jail. When that crew went away, they didnt go as reasonable men, they went because we were there. Theres something in our world that makes men lose their headsthey couldnt be fair if they tried. In our courts, when its a white mans word against a black mans, the white man always wins. Theyre ugly, but those are the facts of life. Doesnt make it right, said Jem stolidly. He beat his fist softly on his knee. You just cant convict a man on evidence like thatyou cant. You couldnt, but they could and did. The older you grow the more of it youll see. The one place where a man ought to get a square deal is in a courtroom, be he any color of the rainbow, but people have a way of carrying their resentments right into a jury box. As you grow older, youll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and dont you forget itwhenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes from, that white man is trash. Atticus was speaking so quietly his last word crashed on our ears. I looked up, and his face was vehement. Theres nothing more sickening to me than a low-grade white man wholl take advantage of a Negros ignorance. Dont fool yourselvesits all adding up and one of these days were going to pay the bill for it. I hope its not in you childrens time. Jem was scratching his head. Suddenly his eyes widened. Atticus, he said, why dont people like us and Miss Maudie ever sit on juries? You never see anybody from Maycomb on a jurythey all come from out in the woods. Atticus leaned back in his rocking-chair. For some reason he looked pleased with Jem. I was wondering when thatd occur to you, he said. There are lots of reasons. For one thing, Miss Maudie cant serve on a jury because shes a woman You mean women in Alabama cant? I was indignant. I do. I guess its to protect our frail ladies from sordid cases like Toms. Besides, Atticus grinned, I doubt if wed ever get a complete case triedthe ladiesd be interrupting to ask questions. Jem and I laughed. Miss Maudie on a jury would be impressive. I thought of old Mrs. Dubose in her wheelchairStop that rapping, John Taylor, I want to ask this man something. Perhaps our forefathers were wise. Atticus was saying, With people like usthats our share of the bill. We generally get the juries we deserve. Our stout Maycomb citizens arent interested, in the first place. In the second place, theyre afraid. Then, theyre Afraid, why? asked Jem. Well, what ifsay, Mr. Link Deas had to decide the amount of damages to award, say, Miss Maudie, when Miss Rachel ran over her with a car. Link wouldnt like the thought of losing either ladys business at his store, would he? So he tells Judge Taylor that he cant serve on the jury because he doesnt have anybody to keep store for him while hes gone. So Judge Taylor excuses him. Sometimes he excuses him wrathfully. Whatd make him think either one of emd stop trading with him? I asked. Jem said, Miss Rachel would, Miss Maudie wouldnt. But a jurys votessecret, Atticus. Our father chuckled. Youve many more miles to go, son. A jurys votes supposed to be secret. Serving on a jury forces a man to make up his mind and declare himself about something. Men dont like to do that. Sometimes its unpleasant. Toms jury sho made up its mind in a hurry, Jem muttered. Atticuss fingers went to his watchpocket. No it didnt, he said, more to himself than to us. That was the one thing that made me think, well, this may be the shadow of a beginning. That jury took a few hours. An inevitable verdict, maybe, but usually it takes em just a few minutes. This time he broke off and looked at us. You might like to know that there was one fellow who took considerable wearing downin the beginning he was rarin for an outright acquittal. Who? Jem was astonished. Atticuss eyes twinkled. Its not for me to say, but Ill tell you this much. He was one of your Old Sarum friends One of the Cunninghams? Jem yelped. One ofI didnt recognize any of em youre jokin. He looked at Atticus from the corners of his eyes. One of their connections. On a hunch, I didnt strike him. Just on a hunch. Couldve, but I didnt. Golly Moses, Jem said reverently. One minute theyre tryin to kill him and the next theyre tryin to turn him loose Ill never understand those folks as long as I live. Atticus said you just had to know em. He said the Cunninghams hadnt taken anything from or off of anybody since they migrated to the New World. He said the other thing about them was, once you earned their respect they were for you tooth and nail. Atticus said he had a feeling, nothing more than a suspicion, that they left the jail that night with considerable respect for the Finches. Then too, he said, it took a thunderbolt plus another Cunningham to make one of them change his mind. If wed had two of that crowd, wedve had a hung jury. Jem said slowly, You mean you actually put on the jury a man who wanted to kill you the night before? How could you take such a risk, Atticus, how could you? When you analyze it, there was little risk. Theres no difference between one man whos going to convict and another man whos going to convict, is there? Theres a faint difference between a man whos going to convict and a man whos a little disturbed in his mind, isnt there? He was the only uncertainty on the whole list. What kin was that man to Mr. Walter Cunningham? I asked. Atticus rose, stretched and yawned. It was not even our bedtime, but we knew he wanted a chance to read his newspaper. He picked it up, folded it, and tapped my head. Lets see now, he droned to himself. Ive got it. Double first cousin. How can that be? Two sisters married two brothers. Thats all Ill tell youyou figure it out. I tortured myself and decided that if I married Jem and Dill had a sister whom he married our children would be double first cousins. Gee minetti, Jem, I said, when Atticus had gone, theyre funny folks. d you hear that, Aunty? Aunt Alexandra was hooking a rug and not watching us, but she was listening. She sat in her chair with her workbasket beside it, her rug spread across her lap. Why ladies hooked woolen rugs on boiling nights never became clear to me. I heard it, she said. I remembered the distant disastrous occasion when I rushed to young Walter Cunninghams defense. Now I was glad Id done it. Soons school starts Im gonna ask Walter home to dinner, I planned, having forgotten my private resolve to beat him up the next time I saw him. He can stay over sometimes after school, too. Atticus could drive him back to Old Sarum. Maybe he could spend the night with us sometime, okay, Jem? Well see about that, Aunt Alexandra said, a declaration that with her was always a threat, never a promise. Surprised, I turned to her. Why not, Aunty? Theyre good folks. She looked at me over her sewing glasses. Jean Louise, there is no doubt in my mind that theyre good folks. But theyre not our kind of folks. Jem says, She means theyre yappy, Scout. Whats a yap? Aw, tacky. They like fiddlin and things like that. Well I do too Dont be silly, Jean Louise, said Aunt Alexandra. The thing is, you can scrub Walter Cunningham till he shines, you can put him in shoes and a new suit, but hell never be like Jem. Besides, theres a drinking streak in that family a mile wide. Finch women arent interested in that sort of people. Aun-ty, said Jem, she aint nine yet. She may as well learn it now. Aunt Alexandra had spoken. I was reminded vividly of the last time she had put her foot down. I never knew why. It was when I was absorbed with plans to visit Calpurnias houseI was curious, interested; I wanted to be her company, to see how she lived, who her friends were. I might as well have wanted to see the other side of the moon. This time the tactics were different, but Aunt Alexandras aim was the same. Perhaps this was why she had come to live with usto help us choose our friends. I would hold her off as long as I could: If theyre good folks, then why cant I be nice to Walter? I didnt say not to be nice to him. You should be friendly and polite to him, you should be gracious to everybody, dear. But you dont have to invite him home. What if he was kin to us, Aunty? The fact is that he is not kin to us, but if he were, my answer would be the same. Aunty, Jem spoke up, Atticus says you can choose your friends but you sho cant choose your family, an theyre still kin to you no matter whether you acknowledge em or not, and it makes you look right silly when you dont. Thats your father all over again, said Aunt Alexandra, and I still say that Jean Louise will not invite Walter Cunningham to this house. If he were her double first cousin once removed he would still not be received in this house unless he comes to see Atticus on business. Now that is that. She had said Indeed Not, but this time she would give her reasons: But I want to play with Walter, Aunty, why cant I? She took off her glasses and stared at me. Ill tell you why, she said. Because heistrash, thats why you cant play with him. Ill not have you around him, picking up his habits and learning Lord-knows-what. Youre enough of a problem to your father as it is. I dont know what I would have done, but Jem stopped me. He caught me by the shoulders, put his arm around me, and led me sobbing in fury to his bedroom. Atticus heard us and poked his head around the door. s all right, sir, Jem said gruffly, s not anything. Atticus went away. Have a chew, Scout. Jem dug into his pocket and extracted a Tootsie Roll. It took a few minutes to work the candy into a com
ortable wad inside my jaw. Jem was rearranging the objects on his dresser. His hair stuck up behind and down in front, and I wondered if it would ever look like a mansmaybe if he shaved it off and started over, his hair would grow back neatly in place. His eyebrows were becoming heavier, and I noticed a new slimness about his body. He was growing taller. When he looked around, he must have thought I would start crying again, for he said, Show you something if you wont tell anybody. I said what. He unbuttoned his shirt, grinning shyly. Well what? Well cant you see it? Wellno. Well itshair.Where? There. Right there. He had been a comfort to me, so I said it looked lovely, but I didnt see anything. Its real nice, Jem. Under my arms, too, he said. Goin out for football next year. Scout, dont let Aunty aggravate you. It seemed only yesterday that he was telling me not to aggravate Aunty. You know shes not used to girls, said Jem, leastways, not girls like you. Shes trying to make you a lady. Cant you take up sewin or somethin? Hell no. She doesnt like me, thats all there is to it, and I dont care. It was her callin Walter Cunningham trash that got me goin, Jem, not what she said about being a problem to Atticus. We got that all straight one time, I asked him if I was a problem and he said not much of one, at most one that he could always figure out, and not to worry my head a second about botherin him. Naw, it was Walterthat boys not trash, Jem. He aint like the Ewells. Jem kicked off his shoes and swung his feet to the bed. He propped himself against a pillow and switched on the reading light. You know something, Scout? Ive got it all figured out, now. Ive thought about it a lot lately and Ive got it figured out. Theres four kinds of folks in the world. Theres the ordinary kind like us and the neighbors, theres the kind like the Cunninghams out in the woods, the kind like the Ewells down at the dump, and the Negroes. What about the Chinese, and the Cajuns down yonder in Baldwin County? I mean in Maycomb County. The thing about it is, our kind of folks dont like the Cunninghams, the Cunninghams dont like the Ewells, and the Ewells hate and despise the colored folks. I told Jem if that was so, then why didnt Toms jury, made up of folks like the Cunninghams, acquit Tom to spite the Ewells? Jem waved my question away as being infantile. You know, he said, Ive seen Atticus pat his foot when theres fiddlin on the radio, and he loves pot liquor bettern any man I ever saw Then that makes us like the Cunninghams, I said. I cant see why Aunty No,lemmefinishitdoes,butwerestilldifferentsomehow.Atticussaidonetimethe reason Auntys so hipped on the family is because all weve gots background and not a dime to our names. Well Jem, I dont knowAtticus told me one time that most of this Old Family stuffs foolishness because everybodys familys just as old as everybody elses. I said did that include the colored folks and Englishmen and he said yes. Background doesnt mean Old Family, said Jem. I think its how long your familys been readin and writin. Scout, Ive studied this real hard and thats the only reason I can think of. Somewhere along when the Finches were in Egypt one of em must have learned a hieroglyphic or two and he taught his boy. Jem laughed. Imagine Aunty being proud her great-grandaddy could read an writeladies pick funny things to be proud of. Well Im glad he could, or whoda taught Atticus and them, and if Atticus couldnt read, you and med be in a fix. I dont think thats what background is, Jem. Wellthen,howdoyouexplainwhytheCunninghamsaredifferent?Mr.Waltercan hardly sign his name, Ive seen him. Weve just been readin and writin longern they have. No, everybodys gotta learn, nobodys born knowin. That Walters as smart as he can be, he just gets held back sometimes because he has to stay out and help his daddy. Nothins wrong with him. Naw, Jem, I think theres just one kind of folks. Folks. Jem turned around and punched his pillow. When he settled back his face was cloudy. He was going into one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came together; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while. Thats what I thought, too, he said at last, when I was your age. If theres just one kind of folks, why cant they get along with each other? If theyre all alike, why do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think Im beginning to understand something. I think Im beginning to understand why Boo Radleys stayed shut up in the house all this time its because hewantsto stay inside.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch23,"The next drama of the day is that Bob Ewell spits in the face of Atticus and says he'll get him back for embarrassing him so badly in court. Atticus passes it off as an empty threat, and does his best to assuage the fears of Jem and Scout, who are very worried for him. Atticus has not lost hope for Tom Robinson, either. There's still the appeal, which he's confident that they have a good chance of winning. As Jem and Scout discuss the lives and ways of Maycomb county folks after the trial, they begin to realize something disturbing about human nature, and the ways people can come up with to just be mean spirited. Jem begins to understand that the reason Boo Radley never comes out of his house is not because he can't, but is because he doesn't want to come out."
"Calpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron. She carried a tray of charlotte. She backed up to the swinging door and pressed gently. I admired the ease and grace with which she handled heavy loads of dainty things. So did Aunt Alexandra, I guess, because she had let Calpurnia serve today. August was on the brink of September. Dill would be leaving for Meridian tomorrow; today he was off with Jem at Barkers Eddy. Jem had discovered with angry amazement that nobody had ever bothered to teach Dill how to swim, a skill Jem considered necessary as walking. They had spent two afternoons at the creek, they said they were going in naked and I couldnt come, so I divided the lonely hours between Calpurnia and Miss Maudie. Today Aunt Alexandra and her missionary circle were fighting the good fight all over the house. From the kitchen, I heard Mrs. Grace Merriweather giving a report in the livingroom on the squalid lives of the Mrunas, it sounded like to me. They put the women out in huts when their time came, whatever that was; they had no sense of familyI knew thatd distress Auntythey subjected children to terrible ordeals when they were thirteen; they were crawling with yaws and earworms, they chewed up and spat out the bark of a tree into a communal pot and then got drunk on it. Immediately thereafter, the ladies adjourned for refreshments. I didnt know whether to go into the diningroom or stay out. Aunt Alexandra told me to join them for refreshments; it was not necessary that I attend the business part of the meeting, she said itd bore me. I was wearing my pink Sunday dress, shoes, and a petticoat, and reflected that if I spilled anything Calpurnia would have to wash my dress again for tomorrow. This had been a busy day for her. I decided to stay out. Can I help you, Cal? I asked, wishing to be of some service. Calpurnia paused in the doorway. You be still as a mouse in that corner, she said, an you can help me load up the trays when I come back. The gentle hum of ladies voices grew louder as she opened the door: Why, Alexandra, I never saw such charlotte just lovely I never can get my crust like this, never can whodve thought of little dewberry tarts Calpurnia? whoda thought it anybody tell you that the preachers wifes nooo, well she is, and that other one not walkin yet They became quiet, and I knew they had all been served. Calpurnia returned and put my mothers heavy silver pitcher on a tray. This coffee pitchers a curiosity, she murmured, they dont make em these days. Can I carry it in? If you be careful and dont drop it. Set it down at the end of the table by Miss Alexandra. Down there by the cupsn things. Shes gonna pour. I tried pressing my behind against the door as Calpurnia had done, but the door didnt budge. Grinning, she held it open for me. Careful now, its heavy. Dont look at it and you wont spill it. My journey was successful: Aunt Alexandra smiled brilliantly. Stay with us, Jean Louise, she said. This was a part of her campaign to teach me to be a lady. It was customary for every circle hostess to invite her neighbors in for refreshments, be they Baptists or Presbyterians, which accounted for the presence of Miss Rachel (sober as a judge), Miss Maudie and Miss Stephanie Crawford. Rather nervous, I took a seat beside Miss Maudie and wondered why ladies put on their hats to go across the street. Ladies in bunches always filled me with vague apprehension and a firm desire to be elsewhere, but this feeling was what Aunt Alexandra called being spoiled. The ladies were cool in fragile pastel prints: most of them were heavily powdered but unrouged; the only lipstick in the room was Tangee Natural. Cutex Natural sparkled on their fingernails, but some of the younger ladies wore Rose. They smelled heavenly. I sat quietly, having conquered my hands by tightly gripping the arms of the chair, and waited for someone to speak to me. Miss Maudies gold bridgework twinkled. Youre mighty dressed up, Miss Jean Louise, she said, Where are your britches today? Under my dress. I hadnt meant to be funny, but the ladies laughed. My cheeks grew hot as I realized my mistake, but Miss Maudie looked gravely down at me. She never laughed at me unless I meant to be funny. In the sudden silence that followed, Miss Stephanie Crawford called from across the room, Whatcha going to be when you grow up, Jean Louise? A lawyer? Nome, I hadnt thought about it I answered, grateful that Miss Stephanie was kind enough to change the subject. Hurriedly I began choosing my vocation. Nurse? Aviator? Well Why shoot, I thought you wanted to be a lawyer, youve already commenced going to court. The ladies laughed again. That Stephanies a card, somebody said. Miss Stephanie was encouraged to pursue the subject: Dont you want to grow up to be a lawyer? Miss Maudies hand touched mine and I answered mildly enough, Nome, just a lady. Miss Stephanie eyed me suspiciously, decided that I meant no impertinence, and contented herself with, Well, you wont get very far until you start wearing dresses more often. Miss Maudies hand closed tightly on mine, and I said nothing. Its warmth was enough. Mrs. Grace Merriweather sat on my left, and I felt it would be polite to talk to her. Mr. Merriweather, a faithful Methodist under duress, apparently saw nothing personal in singing, Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me It was the general opinion of Maycomb, however, that Mrs. Merriweather had sobered him up and made a reasonably useful citizen of him. For certainly Mrs. Merriweather was the most devout lady in Maycomb. I searched for a topic of interest to her. What did you all study this afternoon? I asked. Oh child, those poor Mrunas, she said, and was off. Few other questions would be necessary. Mrs. Merriweathers large brown eyes always filled with tears when she considered the oppressed. Living in that jungle with nobody but J. Grimes Everett, she said. Not a white personll go near em but that saintly J. GrimesEverett. Mrs. Merriweather played her voice like an organ; every word she said received its full measure: The poverty the darkness the immoralitynobody but J. Grimes Everett knows. You know, when the church gave me that trip to the camp grounds J. Grimes Everett said to me Was he there, maam? I thought Home on leave. J. Grimes Everett said to me, he said, Mrs. Merriweather, you have no conception, no conception of what we are fighting over there. Thats what he said to me. Yes maam. I said to him, Mr. Everett, I said, the ladies of the Maycomb Alabama Methodist Episcopal Church South are behind you one hundred percent. Thats what I said to him. And you know, right then and there I made a pledge in my heart. I said to myself, when I go home Im going to give a course on the Mrunas and bring J. Grimes Everetts message to Maycomb and thats just what Im doing. Yes maam. When Mrs. Merriweather shook her head, her black curls jiggled. Jean Louise, she said, you are a fortunate girl. You live in a Christian home with Christian folks in a Christian town. Out there in J. Grimes Everetts land theres nothing but sin and squalor. Yesmaam. Sin and squalorwhat was that, Gertrude? Mrs. Merriweather turned on her chimes fortheladysittingbesideher.Ohthat.Well,Ialwayssayforgiveandforget,forgiveand forget. Thing that church ought to do is help her lead a Christian life for those children from here on out. Some of the men ought to go out there and tell that preacher to encourage her. Excuse me, Mrs. Merriweather, I interrupted, are you all talking about Mayella Ewell? May? No, child. That darkys wife. Toms wife, Tom Robinson, maam. Mrs. Merriweather turned back to her neighbor. Theres one thing I truly believe, Gertrude, she continued, but some people just dont see it my way. If we just let them know we forgive em, that weve forgotten it, then this whole thingll blow over. AhMrs. Merriweather, I interrupted once more, whatll blow over? Again, she turned to me. Mrs. Merriweather was one of those childless adults who find it necessary to assume a different tone of voice when speaking to children. Nothing, Jean Louise, she said, in stately largo, the cooks and field hands are just dissatisfied, but theyre settling down nowthey grumbled all next day after that trial. Mrs. Merriweather faced Mrs. Farrow: Gertrude, I tell you theres nothing more distracting than a sulky darky. Their mouths go down to here. Just ruins your day to have one of em in the kitchen. You know what I said to my Sophy, Gertrude? I said, Sophy, I said, you simply are not being a Christian today. Jesus Christ never went around grumbling and complaining, and you know, it did her good. She took her eyes off that floor and said, Nome, Miz Merriweather, Jesus never went around grumblin. I tell you, Gertrude, you never ought to let an opportunity go by to witness for the Lord. I was reminded of the ancient little organ in the chapel at Finchs Landing. When I was very small, and if I had been very good during the day, Atticus would let me pump its bellows while he picked out a tune with one finger. The last note would linger as long as there was air to sustain it. Mrs. Merriweather had run out of air, I judged, and was replenishing her supply while Mrs. Farrow composed herself to speak. Mrs. Farrow was a splendidly built woman with pale eyes and narrow feet. She had a fresh permanent wave, and her hair was a mass of tight gray ringlets. She was the second most devout lady in Maycomb. She had a curious habit of prefacing everything she said with a soft sibilant sound. S-s-s Grace, she said, its just like I was telling Brother Hutson the other day. S-s-s Brother Hutson, I said, looks like were fighting a losing battle, a losing battle. I said, S- s-s it doesnt matter to em one bit. We can educate em till were blue in the face, we can try till we drop to make Christians out of em, but theres no lady safe in her bed these nights. He said to me, Mrs. Farrow, I dont know what were coming to down here. S-s-s I told him that was certainly afact. Mrs. Merriweather nodded wisely. Her voice soared over the clink of coffee cups and the soft bovine sounds of the ladies munching their dainties. Gertrude, she said, I tell you there are some good but misguided people in this town. Good, but misguided. Folks in this town who think theyre doing right, I mean. Now far be it from me to say who, but some of em in this town thought they were doing the right thing a while back, but all they did was stir em up. Thats all they did. Mightve looked like the right thing to do at the time, Im sure I dont know, Im not read in that field, but sulky dissatisfied I tell you if my Sophyd kept it up another day Id have let her go. Its never entered that wool of hers that the only reason I keep her is because this depressions on and she needs her dollar and a quarter every week she can getit. His food doesnt stick going down, does it? Miss Maudie said it. Two tight lines had appeared at the corners of her mouth. She had been sitting silently beside me, her coffee cup balanced on one knee. I had lost the thread of conversation long ago, when they quit talking about Tom Robinsons wife, and had contented myself with thinking of Finchs Landing and the river. Aunt Alexandra had got it backwards: the business part of the meeting was blood-curdling, the social hour was dreary. Maudie, Im sure I dont know what you mean, said Mrs. Merriweather. Im sure you do, Miss Maudie said shortly. She said no more. When Miss Maudie was angry her brevity was icy. Something had made her deeply angry, and her gray eyes were as cold as her voice. Mrs. Merriweather reddened, glanced at me, and looked away. I could not see Mrs. Farrow. Aunt Alexandra got up from the table and swiftly passed more refreshments, neatly engaging Mrs. Merriweather and Mrs. Gates in brisk conversation. When she had them well on the road with Mrs. Perkins, Aunt Alexandra stepped back. She gave Miss Maudie a look of pure gratitude, and I wondered at the world of women. Miss Maudie and Aunt Alexandra had never been especially close, and here was Aunty silently thanking her for something. For what, I knew not. I was content to learn that Aunt Alexandra could be pierced sufficiently to feel gratitude for help given. There was no doubt about it, I must soon enter this world, where on its surface fragrant ladies rocked slowly, fanned gently, and drank cool water. But I was more at home in my fathers world. People like Mr. Heck Tate did not trap you with innocent questions to make fun of you; even Jem was not highly critical unless you said something stupid. Ladies seemed to live in faint horror of men, seemed unwilling to approve wholeheartedly of them. But I liked them. There was something about them, no matter how much they cussed and drank and gambled and chewed; no matter how undelectable they were, there was something about them that I instinctively liked they werent Hypocrites, Mrs. Perkins, born hypocrites, Mrs. Merriweather was saying. At least we dont have that sin on our shoulders down here. People up there set em free, but you dont see em settin at the table with em. At least we dont have the deceit to say to em yes youre as good as we are but stay away from us. Down here we just say you live your way and well live ours. I think that woman, that Mrs. Roosevelts lost her mindjust plain lost her mind coming down to Birmingham and tryin to sit with em. If I was the Mayor of BirminghamId Well, neither of us was the Mayor of Birmingham, but I wished I was the Governor of Alabama for one day: Id let Tom Robinson go so quick the Missionary Society wouldnt have time to catch its breath. Calpurnia was telling Miss Rachels cook the other day how bad Tom was taking things and she didnt stop talking when I came into the kitchen. She said there wasnt a thing Atticus could do to make being shut up easier for him, that the last thing he said to Atticus before they took him down to the prison camp was, Good-bye, Mr. Finch, there aint nothin you can do now, so there aint no use tryin. Calpurnia said Atticus told her that the day they took Tom to prison he just gave up hope. She said Atticus tried to explain things to him, and that he must do his best not to lose hope because Atticus was doing his best to get him free. Miss Rachels cook asked Calpurnia why didnt Atticus just say yes, youll go free, and leave it at thatseemed like thatd be a big comfort to Tom. Calpurnia said, Because you aint familiar with the law. First thing you learn when youre in a lawin family is that there aint any definite answers toanything.Mr.Finchcouldntsaysomethinssowhenhedoesntknowforsureitsso. The front door slammed and I heard Atticuss footsteps in the hall. Automatically I wondered what time it was. Not nearly time for him to be home, and on Missionary Society days he usually stayed downtown until black dark. He stopped in the doorway. His hat was in his hand, and his face was white. Excuse me, ladies, he said. Go right ahead with your meeting, dont let me disturb you. Alexandra, could you come to the kitchen a minute? I want to borrow Calpurnia for a while. He didnt go through the diningroom, but went down the back hallway and entered the kitchen from the rear door. Aunt Alexandra and I met him. The diningroom door opened again and Miss Maudie joined us. Calpurnia had half risen from her chair. Cal, Atticus said, I want you to go with me out to Helen Robinsons house Whats the matter? Aunt Alexandra asked, alarmed by the look on my fathers face. Toms dead. Aunt Alexandra put her hands to her mouth. They shot him, said Atticus. He was running. It was during their exercise period. They said he just broke into a blind raving charge at the fence and started climbing over. Right in front of them Didnt they try to stop him? Didnt they give him any warning? Aunt Alexandras voice shook. Oh yes, the guards called to him to stop. They fired a few shots in the air, then to kill. They got him just as he went over the fence. They said if hed
had two good arms hed have made it, he was moving that fast. Seventeen bullet holes in him. They didnt have to shoot him that much. Cal, I want you to come out with me and help me tell Helen. Yes sir, she murmured, fumbling at her apron. Miss Maudie went to Calpurnia and untied it. This is the last straw, Atticus, Aunt Alexandra said. Depends on how you look at it, he said. What was one Negro, more or less, among two hundred of em? He wasnt Tom to them, he was an escaping prisoner. Atticus leaned against the refrigerator, pushed up his glasses, and rubbed his eyes. We had such a good chance, he said. I told him what I thought, but I couldnt in truth say that we had more than a good chance. I guess Tom was tired of white mens chances and preferred to take his own. Ready, Cal? Yessir, Mr. Finch. Then lets go. Aunt Alexandra sat down in Calpurnias chair and put her hands to her face. She sat quite still; she was so quiet I wondered if she would faint. I heard Miss Maudie breathing as if she had just climbed the steps, and in the diningroom the ladies chattered happily. I thought Aunt Alexandra was crying, but when she took her hands away from her face, she was not. She looked weary. She spoke, and her voice was flat. I cant say I approve of everything he does, Maudie, but hes my brother, and I just want to know when this will ever end. Her voice rose: It tears him to pieces. He doesnt show it much, but it tears him to pieces. Ive seen him whenwhat else do they want from him, Maudie, what else? What does who want, Alexandra? Miss Maudie asked. I mean this town. Theyre perfectly willing to let him do what theyre too afraid to do themselvesit might lose em a nickel. Theyre perfectly willing to let him wreck his health doing what theyre afraid to do, theyre Be quiet, theyll hear you, said Miss Maudie. Have you ever thought of it this way, Alexandra? Whether Maycomb knows it or not, were paying the highest tribute we can pay a man. We trust him to do right. Its that simple. Who? Aunt Alexandra never knew she was echoing her twelve-year-old nephew. The handful of people in this town who say that fair play is not marked White Only; the handful of people who say a fair trial is for everybody, not just us; the handful of people with enough humility to think, when they look at a Negro, there but for the Lords kindness am l. Miss Maudies old crispness was returning: The handful of people in this town with background, thats who they are. Had I been attentive, I would have had another scrap to add to Jems definition of background, but I found myself shaking and couldnt stop. I had seen Enfield Prison Farm, and Atticus had pointed out the exercise yard to me. It was the size of a football field. Stop that shaking, commanded Miss Maudie, and I stopped. Get up, Alexandra, weve left em long enough. Aunt Alexandra rose and smoothed the various whalebone ridges along her hips. She took her handkerchief from her belt and wiped her nose. She patted her hair and said, Do I show it? Not a sign, said Miss Maudie. Are you together again, Jean Louise? Yes maam. Then lets join the ladies, she said grimly. Their voices swelled when Miss Maudie opened the door to the diningroom. Aunt Alexandra was ahead of me, and I saw her head go up as she went through the door. Oh, Mrs. Perkins, she said, you need some more coffee. Let me get it. Calpurnias on an errand for a few minutes, Grace, said Miss Maudie. Let me pass you some more of those dewberry tarts. dyou hear what that cousin of mine did the other day, the one who likes to go fishing? And so they went, down the row of laughing women, around the diningroom, refilling coffee cups, dishing out goodies as though their only regret was the temporary domestic disaster of losing Calpurnia. The gentle hum began again. Yes sir, Mrs. Perkins, that J. Grimes Everett is a martyred saint, he needed to get married so they ran to the beauty parlor every Saturday afternoon soon as the sun goes down. He goes to bed with the chickens, a crate full of sick chickens, Fred says thats what started it all. Fred says Aunt Alexandra looked across the room at me and smiled. She looked at a tray of cookies on the table and nodded at them. I carefully picked up the tray and watched myself walk to Mrs. Merriweather. With my best company manners, I asked her if she would have some. After all, if Aunty could be a lady at a time like this, so could I.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch24,"As September inches closer Scout is introduced to formal tea time, hosted by Aunt Alexandra, who is on a relentless campaign to teach her to be a lady. As Scout navigates through the social hour she's lost on how ladies can look so pretty and delicate, and yet trap each other with conversation, revealing an aggressiveness you can't really see except when they talk to each other. She decides she feels much more at home in her father's world. When Atticus comes home early from work and interrupts tea Scout knows something's up. She follows him into the kitchen and learns that Tom Robinson is dead. He made a break for it at the prison and was shot by the guards.

"Dont do that, Scout. Set him out on the back steps. Jem, are you crazy? I said set him out on the backsteps. Sighing, I scooped up the small creature, placed him on the bottom step and went back to my cot. September had come, but not a trace of cool weather with it, and we were still sleeping on the back screen porch. Lightning bugs were still about, the night crawlers and flying insects that beat against the screen the summer long had not gone wherever they go when autumncomes. A roly-poly had found his way inside the house; I reasoned that the tiny varmint had crawled up the steps and under the door. I was putting my book on the floor beside my cot when I saw him. The creatures are no more than an inch long, and when you touch them they roll themselves into a tight gray ball. I lay on my stomach, reached down and poked him. He rolled up. Then, feeling safe, I suppose, he slowly unrolled. He traveled a few inches on his hundred legs and I touched him again. He rolled up. Feeling sleepy, I decided to end things. My hand was going down on him when Jem spoke. Jem was scowling. It was probably a part of the stage he was going through, and I wished he would hurry up and get through it. He was certainly never cruel to animals, but I had never known his charity to embrace the insect world. Why couldnt I mash him? I asked. Because they dont bother you, Jem answered in the darkness. He had turned out his reading light. Reckon youre at the stage now where you dont kill flies and mosquitoes now, I reckon, I said. Lemme know when you change your mind. Tell you one thing, though, I aint gonna sit around and not scratch a redbug. Aw dry up, he answered drowsily. Jem was the one who was getting more like a girl every day, not I. Comfortable, I lay on my back and waited for sleep, and while waiting I thought of Dill. He had left us the first of the month with firm assurances that he would return the minute school was out he guessed his folks had got the general idea that he liked to spend his summers in Maycomb. Miss Rachel took us with them in the taxi to Maycomb Junction, and Dill waved to us from the train window until he was out of sight. He was not out of mind: I missed him. The last two days of his time with us, Jem had taught him to swim Taught him to swim. I was wide awake, remembering what Dill had told me. Barkers Eddy is at the end of a dirt road off the Meridian highway about a mile from town. It is easy to catch a ride down the highway on a cotton wagon or from a passing motorist, and the short walk to the creek is easy, but the prospect of walking all the way back home at dusk, when the traffic is light, is tiresome, and swimmers are careful not to stay too late. According to Dill, he and Jem had just come to the highway when they saw Atticus driving toward them. He looked like he had not seen them, so they both waved. Atticus finally slowed down; when they caught up with him he said, Youd better catch a ride back. I wont be going home for a while. Calpurnia was in the back seat. Jem protested, then pleaded, and Atticus said, All right, you can come with us if you stay in the car. On the way to Tom Robinsons, Atticus told them what had happened. They turned off the highway, rode slowly by the dump and past the Ewell residence, down the narrow lane to the Negro cabins. Dill said a crowd of black children were playing marbles in Toms front yard. Atticus parked the car and got out. Calpurnia followed him through the front gate. Dill heard him ask one of the children, Wheres your mother, Sam? and heard Sam say, She down at Sis Stevenss, Mr. Finch. Want me run fetch her? Dill said Atticus looked uncertain, then he said yes, and Sam scampered off. Go on with your game, boys, Atticus said to the children. A little girl came to the cabin door and stood looking at Atticus. Dill said her hair was a wad of tiny stiff pigtails, each ending in a bright bow. She grinned from ear to ear and walked toward our father, but she was too small to navigate the steps. Dill said Atticus went to her, took off his hat, and offered her his finger. She grabbed it and he eased her down the steps. Then he gave her to Calpurnia. Sam was trotting behind his mother when they came up. Dill said Helen said, evenin, Mr. Finch, wont you have a seat? But she didnt say any more. Neither did Atticus. Scout, said Dill, she just fell down in the dirt. Just fell down in the dirt, like a giant with a big foot just came along and stepped on her. Just ump Dills fat foot hit the ground. Like youd step on an ant. Dill said Calpurnia and Atticus lifted Helen to her feet and half carried, half walked her to the cabin. They stayed inside a long time, and Atticus came out alone. When they drove back by the dump, some of the Ewells hollered at them, but Dill didnt catch what they said. Maycomb was interested by the news of Toms death for perhaps two days; two days was enough for the information to spread through the county. Did you hear about? No? Well, they say he was runnin fit to beat lightnin To Maycomb, Toms death was typical. Typical of a nigger to cut and run. Typical of a niggers mentality to have no plan, no thought for the future, just run blind first chance he saw. Funny thing, Atticus Finch mightve got him off scot free, but wait? Hell no. You know how they are. Easy come, easy go. Just shows you, that Robinson boy was legally married, they say he kept himself clean, went to church and all that, but when it comes down to the line the veneers mighty thin. Nigger always comes out in em. A few more details, enabling the listener to repeat his version in turn, then nothing to talk about untilThe Maycomb Tribuneappeared the following Thursday. There was a brief obituary in the Colored News, but there was also an editorial. Mr. B. B. Underwood was at his most bitter, and he couldnt have cared less who canceled advertising and subscriptions. (But Maycomb didnt play that way: Mr. Underwood could holler till he sweated and write whatever he wanted to, hed still get his advertising and subscriptions. If he wanted to make a fool of himself in his paper that was his business.) Mr. Underwood didnt talk about miscarriages of justice, he was writing so children could understand. Mr. Underwood simply figured it was a sin to kill cripples, be they standing, sitting, or escaping. He likened Toms death to the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters and children, and Maycomb thought he was trying to write an editorial poetical enough to be reprinted inThe MontgomeryAdvertiser. How could this be so, I wondered, as I read Mr. Underwoods editorial. Senseless killingTom had been given due process of law to the day of his death; he had been tried openly and convicted by twelve good men and true; my father had fought for him all the way. Then Mr. Underwoods meaning became clear: Atticus had used every tool available to free men to save Tom Robinson, but in the secret courts of mens hearts Atticus had no case. Tom was a dead man the minute Mayella Ewell opened her mouth and screamed. The name Ewell gave me a queasy feeling. Maycomb had lost no time in getting Mr. Ewells views on Toms demise and passing them along through that English Channel of gossip, Miss Stephanie Crawford. Miss Stephanie told Aunt Alexandra in Jems presence (Oh foot, hes old enough to listen.) that Mr. Ewell said it made one down and about two more to go. Jem told me not to be afraid, Mr. Ewell was more hot gas than anything. Jem also told me that if I breathed a word to Atticus, if in any way I let Atticus know I knew, Jem would personally never speak to meagain.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch25,"Jem and Dill were able to witness the sad affair of Atticus having to tell Helen that Tom is dead, as his car passed them as they were walking back from swimming at Barkers Eddy. Atticus was very gentle about it, but Helen fainted away. The town of Maycomb was interested in Toms death for about two days, and then moved on to other things. Jem tells Scout that he heard from the grapevine that Mr. Ewell was threatened them again, saying that there was one down and two to go. Jem believes that he's all talk and warns Scout not to breathe a word to Atticus, and not to worry."
"School started, and so did our daily trips past the Radley Place. Jem was in the seventh grade and went to high school, beyond the grammar-school building; I was now in the third grade, and our routines were so different I only walked to school with Jem in the mornings and saw him at mealtimes. He went out for football, but was too slender and too young yet to do anything but carry the team water buckets. This he did with enthusiasm; most afternoons he was seldom home before dark. The Radley Place had ceased to terrify me, but it was no less gloomy, no less chilly under its great oaks, and no less uninviting. Mr. Nathan Radley could still be seen on a clear day, walking to and from town; we knew Boo was there, for the same old reason nobodyd seen him carried out yet. I sometimes felt a twinge of remorse, when passing by the old place, at ever having taken part in what must have been sheer torment to Arthur Radleywhat reasonable recluse wants children peeping through his shutters, delivering greetings on the end of a fishing-pole, wandering in his collards at night? And yet I remembered. Two Indian-head pennies, chewing gum, soap dolls, a rusty medal, a broken watch and chain. Jem must have put them away somewhere. I stopped and looked at the tree one afternoon: the trunk was swelling around its cement patch. The patch itself was turning yellow. We had almost seen him a couple of times, a good enough score for anybody. But I still looked for him each time I went by. Maybe someday we would see him. I imagined how it would be: when it happened, hed just be sitting in the swing when I came along. Hidy do, Mr. Arthur, I would say, as if I had said it every afternoon of my life. Evening, Jean Louise, he would say, as if he had said it every afternoon of my life, right pretty spell were having, isnt it? Yes sir, right pretty, I would say, and go on. It was only a fantasy. We would never see him. He probably did go out when the moon was down and gaze upon Miss Stephanie Crawford. Id have picked somebody else to look at, but that was his business. He would never gaze at us. You arent starting that again, are you? said Atticus one night, when I expressed a stray desire just to have one good look at Boo Radley before I died. If you are, Ill tell you right now: stop it. Im too old to go chasing you off the Radley property. Besides, its dangerous. You might get shot. You know Mr. Nathan shoots at every shadow he sees, even shadows that leave size-four bare footprints. You were lucky not to be killed. I hushed then and there. At the same time I marveled at Atticus. This was the first he had let us know he knew a lot more about something than we thought he knew. And it had happened years ago. No, only last summerno, summer before last, when time was playing tricks on me. I must remember to ask Jem. So many things had happened to us, Boo Radley was the least of our fears. Atticus said he didnt see how anything else could happen, that things had a way of settling down, and after enough time passed people would forget that Tom Robinsons existence was ever brought to their attention. Perhaps Atticus was right, but the events of the summer hung over us like smoke in a closed room. The adults in Maycomb never discussed the case with Jem and me; it seemed that they discussed it with their children, and their attitude must have been that neither of us could help having Atticus for a parent, so their children must be nice to us in spite of him. The children would never have thought that up for themselves: had our classmates been left to their own devices, Jem and I would have had several swift, satisfying fist-fights apiece and ended the matter for good. As it was, we were compelled to hold our heads high and be, respectively, a gentleman and a lady. In a way, it was like the era of Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose, without all her yelling. There was one odd thing, though, that I never understood: in spite of Atticuss shortcomings as a parent, people were content to re-elect him to the state legislature that year, as usual, without opposition. I came to the conclusion that people were just peculiar, I withdrew from them, and never thought about them until I was forcedto. I was forced to one day in school. Once a week, we had a Current Events period. Each child was supposed to clip an item from a newspaper, absorb its contents, and reveal them to the class. This practice allegedly overcame a variety of evils: standing in front of his fellows encouraged good posture and gave a child poise; delivering a short talk made him word-conscious; learning his current event strengthened his memory; being singled out made him more than ever anxious to return to the Group. The idea was profound, but as usual, in Maycomb it didnt work very well. In the first place, few rural children had access to newspapers, so the burden of Current Events was borne by the town children, convincing the bus children more deeply that the town children got all the attention anyway. The rural children who could, usually brought clippings from what they called The Grit Paper, a publication spurious in the eyes of Miss Gates, our teacher. Why she frowned when a child recited from The Grit Paper I never knew, but in some way it was associated with liking fiddling, eating syrupy biscuits for lunch, being a holy-roller, singing Sweetly Sings the Donkey and pronouncing it dunkey, all of which the state paid teachers todiscourage. Even so, not many of the children knew what a Current Event was. Little Chuck Little, a hundred years old in his knowledge of cows and their habits, was halfway through an Uncle Natchell story when Miss Gates stopped him: Charles, that is not a current event. That is an advertisement. Cecil Jacobs knew what one was, though. When his turn came, he went to the front of the room and began, Old Hitler Adolf Hitler, Cecil, said Miss Gates. One never begins with Old anybody. Yes maam, he said. Old Adolf Hitler has been prosecutin the Persecuting Cecil Nome, Miss Gates, it says herewell anyway, old Adolf Hitler has been after the Jews and hes puttin em in prisons and hes taking away all their property and he wont let any of em out of the country and hes washin all the feeble-minded and Washing the feeble-minded? Yes maam, Miss Gates, I reckon they dont have sense enough to wash themselves, I dont reckon an idiot could keep hisself clean. Well anyway, Hitlers started a program to round up all the half-Jews too and he wants to register em in case they might wanta cause him any trouble and I think this is a bad thing and thats my current event. Very good, Cecil, said Miss Gates. Puffing, Cecil returned to his seat. A hand went up in the back of the room. How can he do that? Who do what? asked Miss Gates patiently. I mean how can Hitler just put a lot of folks in a pen like that, looks like the govamintd stop him, said the owner of the hand. Hitler is the government, said Miss Gates, and seizing an opportunity to make education dynamic, she went to the blackboard. She printed DEMOCRACY in large letters. Democracy, she said. Does anybody have a definition? Us, somebody said. I raised my hand, remembering an old campaign slogan Atticus had once told me about. What do you think it means, Jean Louise? Equal rights for all, special privileges for none, I quoted. Very good, Jean Louise, very good, Miss Gates smiled. In front of DEMOCRACY, she printed WE ARE A. Now class, say it all together, We are a democracy. We said it. Then Miss Gates said, Thats the difference between America and Germany. We are a democracy and Germany is a dictatorship. Dictator-ship, she said. Over here we dont believe in persecuting anybody. Persecution comes from people who are prejudiced. Prejudice, she enunciated carefully. There are no better people in the world than the Jews, and why Hitler doesnt think so is a mystery to me. An inquiring soul in the middle of the room said, Why dont they like the Jews, you reckon, Miss Gates? I dont know, Henry. They contribute to every society they live in, and most of all, they are a deeply religious people. Hitlers trying to do away with religion, so maybe he doesnt like them for that reason. Cecil spoke up. Well I dont know for certain, he said, theyre supposed to change money or somethin, but that aint no cause to persecute em. Theyre white, aint they? Miss Gates said, When you get to high school, Cecil, youll learn that the Jews have been persecuted since the beginning of history, even driven out of their own country. Its one of the most terrible stories in history. Time for arithmetic, children. As I had never liked arithmetic, I spent the period looking out the window. The only time I ever saw Atticus scowl was when Elmer Davis would give us the latest on Hitler. Atticus would snap off the radio and say, Hmp! I asked him once why he was impatient with Hitler and Atticus said, Because hes a maniac. This would not do, I mused, as the class proceeded with its sums. One maniac and millions of German folks. Looked to me like theyd shut Hitler in a pen instead of letting him shut them up. There was something else wrongI would ask my father about it. I did, and he said he could not possibly answer my question because he didnt know the answer. But its okay to hate Hitler? It is not, he said. Its not okay to hate anybody. Atticus, I said, theres somethin I dont understand. Miss Gates said it was awful, Hitler doin like he does, she got real red in the face about it I should think she would. But Yes? Nothing, sir. I went away, not sure that I could explain to Atticus what was on my mind, not sure that I could clarify what was only a feeling. Perhaps Jem could provide the answer. Jem understood school things better than Atticus. Jem was worn out from a days water-carrying. There were at least twelve banana peels on the floor by his bed, surrounding an empty milk bottle. Whatcha stuffin for? I asked. Coach says if I can gain twenty-five pounds by year after next I can play, he said. This is the quickest way. If you dont throw it all up. Jem, I said, I wanta ask you somethin. Shoot. He put down his book and stretched his legs. Miss Gates is a nice lady, aint she? Why sure, said Jem. I liked her when I was in her room. She hates Hitler a lot Whats wrong with that? Well, she went on today about how bad it was him treatin the Jews like that. Jem, its not right to persecute anybody, is it? I mean have mean thoughts about anybody, even, is it? Gracious no, Scout. Whats eatin you? Well, coming out of the courthouse that night Miss Gates wasshe was goin down the steps in front of us, you musta not seen hershe was talking with Miss Stephanie Crawford. I heard her say its time somebody taught em a lesson, they were gettin way above themselves, an the next thing they think they can do is marry us. Jem, how can you hate Hitler so bad an then turn around and be ugly about folks right athome Jemwassuddenlyfurious.Heleapedoffthebed,grabbedmebythecollarandshook me. I never wanta hear about that courthouse again, ever, ever, you hear me? You hear me? Dont you ever say one word to me about it again, you hear? Now goon! I was too surprised to cry. I crept from Jems room and shut the door softly, lest undue noise set him off again. Suddenly tired, I wanted Atticus. He was in the livingroom, and I went to him and tried to get in his lap. Atticus smiled. Youre getting so big now, Ill just have to hold a part of you. He held me close. Scout, he said softly, dont let Jem get you down. Hes having a rough time these days. I heard you back there. Atticus said that Jem was trying hard to forget something, but what he was really doing was storing it away for a while, until enough time passed. Then he would be able to think about it and sort things out. When he was able to think about it, Jem would be himself again.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch26,"As school starts Jem begins high school (7th grade) and Scout rarely sees him until dark. She's in 3rd grade now, and although the Radley place ceases to terrify her she still thinks about Boo, and regrets ever tormenting him the way they used to. One day in class they start talking about Adolf Hitler, and Scout discovers that her teacher, Miss Gates, hates Hitler and feels strongly that his persecution of Jews is wrong. Scout is confused about this, however, because during the summer at the trial she heard Miss Gates distinctly saying ugly things about Tom Robinson, and how this should teach them all a lesson. When she asks Jem about it, why Miss Gates can hate Hitler and yet feel Tom Robinson's verdict is justified because he's black, Jem gets very upset and yells at her not to ever talk about that trial to him again. When she goes to Atticus for comfort he tells her that Jem is just trying to come to terms with something in his head, and when he does he'll start being himself again."
"Things did settle down, after a fashion, as Atticus said they would. By the middle of October, only two small things out of the ordinary happened to two Maycomb citizens. No, there were three things, and they did not directly concern usthe Finchesbut in a way they did. The first thing was that Mr. Bob Ewell acquired and lost a job in a matter of days and probably made himself unique in the annals of the nineteen-thirties: he was the only man I ever heard of who was fired from the WPA for laziness. I suppose his brief burst of fame brought on a briefer burst of industry, but his job lasted only as long as his notoriety: Mr. Ewell found himself as forgotten as Tom Robinson. Thereafter, he resumed his regular weekly appearances at the welfare office for his check, and received it with no grace amid obscure mutterings that the bastards who thought they ran this town wouldnt permit an honest man to make a living. Ruth Jones, the welfare lady, said Mr. Ewell openly accused Atticus of getting his job. She was upset enough to walk down to Atticuss office and tell him about it. Atticus told Miss Ruth not to fret, that if Bob Ewell wanted to discuss Atticuss getting his job, he knew the way to theoffice. The second thing happened to Judge Taylor. Judge Taylor was not a Sunday-night churchgoer: Mrs. Taylor was. Judge Taylor savored his Sunday night hour alone in his big house, and churchtime found him holed up in his study reading the writings of Bob Taylor (no kin, but the judge would have been proud to claim it). One Sunday night, lost in fruity metaphors and florid diction, Judge Taylors attention was wrenched from the page by an irritating scratching noise. Hush, he said to Ann Taylor, his fat nondescript dog. Then he realized he was speaking to an empty room; the scratching noise was coming from the rear of the house. Judge Taylor clumped to the back porch to let Ann out and found the screen door swinging open. A shadow on the corner of the house caught his eye, and that was all he saw of his visitor. Mrs. Taylor came home from church to find her husband in his chair, lost in the writings of Bob Taylor, with a shotgun across his lap. The third thing happened to Helen Robinson, Toms widow. If Mr. Ewell was as forgotten as Tom Robinson, Tom Robinson was as forgotten as Boo Radley. But Tom was not forgotten by his employer, Mr. Link Deas. Mr. Link Deas made a job for Helen. He didnt really need her, but he said he felt right bad about the way things turned out. I never knew who took care of her children while Helen was away. Calpurnia said it was hard on Helen, because she had to walk nearly a mile out of her way to avoid the Ewells, who, according to Helen, chunked at her the first time she tried to use the public road. Mr. Link Deas eventually received the impression that Helen was coming to work each morning from the wrong direction, and dragged the reason out of her. Just let it be, Mr. Link, please suh, Helen begged. The hell I will, said Mr. Link. He told her to come by his store that afternoon before she left. She did, and Mr. Link closed his store, put his hat firmly on his head, and walked Helen home. He walked her the short way, by the Ewells. On his way back, Mr. Link stopped at the crazy gate. Ewell? he called. I say Ewell! The windows, normally packed with children, were empty. I know every last one of yous in there a-layin on the floor! Now hear me, Bob Ewell: if I hear one more peep outa my girl Helen about not bein able to walk this road Ill have you in jail before sundown! Mr. Link spat in the dust and walked home. Helen went to work next morning and used the public road. Nobody chunked at her, but when she was a few yards beyond the Ewell house, she looked around and saw Mr. Ewell walking behind her. She turned and walked on, and Mr. Ewell kept the same distance behind her until she reached Mr. Link Deass house. All the way to the house, Helen said, she heard a soft voice behind her, crooning foul words. Thoroughly frightened, she telephoned Mr. Link at his store, which was not too far from his house. As Mr. Link came out of his store he saw Mr. Ewell leaning on the fence. Mr. Ewell said, Dont you look at me, Link Deas, like I was dirt. I aint jumped your First thing you can do, Ewell, is get your stinkin carcass off my property. Youre leanin on it an I cant afford fresh paint for it. Second thing you can do is stay away from my cook or Ill have you up for assault I aint touched her, Link Deas, and aint about to go with no nigger! You dont have to touch her, all you have to do is make her afraid, an if assault aint enough to keep you locked up awhile, Ill get you in on the Ladies Law, so get outa my sight! If you dont think I mean it, just bother that girl again! Mr. Ewell evidently thought he meant it, for Helen reported no further trouble. I dont like it, Atticus, I dont like it at all, was Aunt Alexandras assessment of these events. That man seems to have a permanent running grudge against everybody connected with that case. I know how that kind are about paying off grudges, but I dont understand why he should harbor onehe had his way in court, didnt he? I think I understand, said Atticus. It might be because he knows in his heart that very few people in Maycomb really believed his and Mayellas yarns. He thought hed be a hero, but all he got for his pain was was, okay, well convict this Negro but get back to your dump. Hes had his fling with about everybody now, so he ought to be satisfied. Hell settle down when the weather changes. But why should he try to burgle John Taylors house? He obviously didnt know John was home or he wouldntve tried. Only lights John shows on Sunday nights are on the front porch and back in his den You dont know if Bob Ewell cut that screen, you dont know who did it, said Atticus. But I can guess. I proved him a liar but John made him look like a fool. All the time Ewell was on the stand I couldnt dare look at John and keep a straight face. John looked at him as if he were a three-legged chicken or a square egg. Dont tell me judges dont try to prejudice juries, Atticus chuckled. By the end of October, our lives had become the familiar routine of school, play, study. Jem seemed to have put out of his mind whatever it was he wanted to forget, and our classmates mercifully let us forget our fathers eccentricities. Cecil Jacobs asked me one time if Atticus was a Radical. When I asked Atticus, Atticus was so amused I was rather annoyed, but he said he wasnt laughing at me. He said, You tell Cecil Im about as radical as Cotton Tom Heflin. Aunt Alexandra was thriving. Miss Maudie must have silenced the whole missionary society at one blow, for Aunty again ruled that roost. Her refreshments grew even more delicious. I learned more about the poor Mrunas social life from listening to Mrs. Merriweather: they had so little sense of family that the whole tribe was one big family. A child had as many fathers as there were men in the community, as many mothers as there were women. J. Grimes Everett was doing his utmost to change this state of affairs, and desperately needed our prayers. Maycomb was itself again. Precisely the same as last year and the year before that, with only two minor changes. Firstly, people had removed from their store windows and automobiles the stickers that said NRAWE DO OUR PART. I asked Atticus why, and he said it was because the National Recovery Act was dead. I asked who killed it: he said nine old men. The second change in Maycomb since last year was not one of national significance. Until then, Halloween in Maycomb was a completely unorganized affair. Each child did what he wanted to do, with assistance from other children if there was anything to be moved, such as placing a light buggy on top of the livery stable. But parents thought things went too far last year, when the peace of Miss Tutti and Miss Frutti was shattered. Misses Tutti and Frutti Barber were maiden ladies, sisters, who lived together in the only Maycomb residence boasting a cellar. The Barber ladies were rumored to be Republicans, having migrated from Clanton, Alabama, in 1911. Their ways were strange to us, and why they wanted a cellar nobody knew, but they wanted one and they dug one, and they spent the rest of their lives chasing generations of children out of it. Misses Tutti and Frutti (their names were Sarah and Frances), aside from their Yankee ways, were both deaf. Miss Tutti denied it and lived in a world of silence, but Miss Frutti, not about to miss anything, employed an ear trumpet so enormous that Jem declared it was a loudspeaker from one of those dog Victrolas. With these facts in mind and Halloween at hand, some wicked children had waited until the Misses Barber were thoroughly asleep, slipped into their livingroom (nobody but the Radleys locked up at night), stealthily made away with every stick of furniture therein, and hid it in the cellar. I deny having taken part in such athing. I heard em! was the cry that awoke the Misses Barbers neighbors at dawn next morning. Heard em drive a truck up to the door! Stomped around like horses. Theyre in New Orleans by now! Miss Tutti was sure those traveling fur sellers who came through town two days ago had purloined their furniture. Da-rk they were, she said. Syrians. Mr. Heck Tate was summoned. He surveyed the area and said he thought it was a local job. Miss Frutti said shed know a Maycomb voice anywhere, and there were no Maycomb voices in that parlor last nightrolling their rs all over her premises, they were. Nothing less than the bloodhounds must be used to locate their furniture, Miss Tutti insisted, so Mr. Tate was obliged to go ten miles out the road, round up the county hounds, and put them on the trail. Mr. Tate started them off at the Misses Barbers front steps, but all they did was run around to the back of the house and howl at the cellar door. When Mr. Tate set them in motion three times, he finally guessed the truth. By noontime that day, there was not a barefooted child to be seen in Maycomb and nobody took off his shoes until the hounds were returned. So the Maycomb ladies said things would be different this year. The high-school auditorium would be open, there would be a pageant for the grown-ups; apple-bobbing, taffy-pulling, pinning the tail on the donkey for the children. There would also be a prize of twenty-five cents for the best Halloween costume, created by the wearer. Jem and I both groaned. Not that wed ever done anything, it was the principle of the thing. Jem considered himself too old for Halloween anyway; he said he wouldnt be caught anywhere near the high school at something like that. Oh well, I thought, Atticus would take me. I soon learned, however, that my services would be required on stage that evening. Mrs. Grace Merriweather had composed an original pageant entitledMaycomb County:Ad Astra Per Aspera, and I was to be a ham. She thought it would be adorable if some of the children were costumed to represent the countys agricultural products: Cecil Jacobs would be dressed up to look like a cow; Agnes Boone would make a lovely butterbean, another child would be a peanut, and on down the line until Mrs. Merriweathers imagination and the supply of children were exhausted. Our only duties, as far as I could gather from our two rehearsals, were to enter from stage left as Mrs. Merriweather (not only the author, but the narrator) identified us. When she called out, Pork, that was my cue. Then the assembled company would sing, Maycomb County, Maycomb County, we will aye be true to thee, as the grand finale, and Mrs. Merriweather would mount the stage with the state flag. My costume was not much of a problem. Mrs. Crenshaw, the local seamstress, had as much imagination as Mrs. Merriweather. Mrs. Crenshaw took some chicken wire and bent it into the shape of a cured ham. This she covered with brown cloth, and painted it to resemble the original. I could duck under and someone would pull the contraption down over my head. It came almost to my knees. Mrs. Crenshaw thoughtfully left two peepholes for me. She did a fine job. Jem said I looked exactly like a ham with legs. There were several discomforts, though: it was hot, it was a close fit; if my nose itched I couldnt scratch, and once inside I could not get out of it alone. When Halloween came, I assumed that the whole family would be present to watch me perform, but I was disappointed. Atticus said as tactfully as he could that he just didnt think he could stand a pageant tonight, he was all in. He had been in Montgomery for a week and had come home late that afternoon. He thought Jem might escort me if I asked him. Aunt Alexandra said she just had to get to bed early, shed been decorating the stage all afternoon and was worn outshe stopped short in the middle of her sentence. She closed her mouth, then opened it to say something, but no words came. s matter, Aunty? I asked. Oh nothing, nothing, she said, somebody just walked over my grave. She put away from her whatever it was that gave her a pinprick of apprehension, and suggested that I give the family a preview in the livingroom. So Jem squeezed me into my costume, stood at the livingroom door, called out Po-ork, exactly as Mrs. Merriweather would have done, and I marched in. Atticus and Aunt Alexandra were delighted. I repeated my part for Calpurnia in the kitchen and she said I was wonderful. I wanted to go across the street to show Miss Maudie, but Jem said shed probably be at the pageant anyway. After that, it didnt matter whether they went or not. Jem said he would take me. Thus began our longest journey together.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch27,"As October crawls forward a few things happen in town. The Judge finds a nighttime crawler in his yard but doesn't see who it is. Helen Robinson, Tom's wife, starts working for Mr. Link Deas, Tom's old employer, who offers her a job because he feels so badly about what happened to Tom. She has to go a mile out of her way to avoid the Ewell place, because each time she passes they antagonize her. When Mr. Deas finds out about it he goes over to the Ewell place and threatens Mr. Ewell to leave Helen alone. The next day Mr. Ewell follows Helen all the way to work and Mr. Deas has to chew him out again. To Aunt Alexandra, it bodes trouble. As Halloween approaches Scout learns that she will be required to participate in the school pageant, an agricultural themed production where she'll be playing the part of ""Pork"". Her costume is a large ham hock fashioned out of brown cloth and chicken wire. Everyone else is too worn out to come to the night's pageant, so Scout and Jem go alone."
"The weather was unusually warm for the last day of October. We didnt even need jackets. The wind was growing stronger, and Jem said it might be raining before we got home. There was no moon. The street light on the corner cast sharp shadows on the Radley house. I heard Jem laugh softly. Bet nobody bothers them tonight, he said. Jem was carrying my ham costume, rather awkwardly, as it was hard to hold. I thought it gallant of him to do so. It is a scary place though, aint it? I said. Boo doesnt mean anybody any harm, but Im right glad youre along. You know Atticus wouldnt let you go to the schoolhouse by yourself, Jem said. Dont see why, its just around the corner and across the yard. That yards a mighty long place for little girls to cross at night, Jem teased. Aint you scared of haints? We laughed. Haints, Hot Steams, incantations, secret signs, had vanished with our years as mist with sunrise. What was that old thing, Jem said, Angel bright, life-in- death; get off the road, dont suck my breath. Cut it out, now, I said. We were in front of the Radley Place. Jem said, Boo must not be at home. Listen. High above us in the darkness a solitary mocker poured out his repertoire in blissful unawareness of whose tree he sat in, plunging from the shrill kee, kee of the sunflower bird to the irascible qua-ack of a bluejay, to the sad lament of Poor Will, Poor Will, Poor Will. We turned the corner and I tripped on a root growing in the road. Jem tried to help me, but all he did was drop my costume in the dust. I didnt fall, though, and soon we were on our way again. We turned off the road and entered the schoolyard. It was pitch black. How do you know where were at, Jem? I asked, when we had gone a few steps. I can tell were under the big oak because were passin through a cool spot. Careful now, and dont fall again. We had slowed to a cautious gait, and were feeling our way forward so as not to bump into the tree. The tree was a single and ancient oak; two children could not reach around its trunk and touch hands. It was far away from teachers, their spies, and curious neighbors: it was near the Radley lot, but the Radleys were not curious. A small patch of earth beneath its branches was packed hard from many fights and furtive crap games. The lights in the high school auditorium were blazing in the distance, but they blinded us, if anything. Dont look ahead, Scout, Jem said. Look at the ground and you wont fall. You should have brought the flashlight, Jem. Didnt know it was this dark. Didnt look like itd be this dark earlier in the evening. So cloudy, thats why. Itll hold off a while, though. Someone leaped at us. God almighty! Jem yelled. A circle of light burst in our faces, and Cecil Jacobs jumped in glee behind it. Ha-a-a, gotcha! he shrieked. Thought youd be comin along this way! What are you doin way out here by yourself, boy? Aint you scared of Boo Radley? Cecil had ridden safely to the auditorium with his parents, hadnt seen us, then had ventured down this far because he knew good and well wed be coming along. He thought Mr. Finchd be with us, though. Shucks, aint much but around the corner, said Jem. Whos scared to go around the corner? We had to admit that Cecil was pretty good, though. Hehadgiven us a fright, and he could tell it all over the schoolhouse, that was his privilege. Say, I said, aint you a cow tonight? Wheres your costume? Its up behind the stage, he said. Mrs. Merriweather says the pageant aint comin on for a while. You can put yours back of the stage by mine, Scout, and we can go with the rest of em. This was an excellent idea, Jem thought. He also thought it a good thing that Ceciland I would be together. This way, Jem would be left to go with people his own age. When we reached the auditorium, the whole town was there except Atticus and the ladies worn out from decorating, and the usual outcasts and shut-ins. Most of the county, it seemed, was there: the hall was teeming with slicked-up country people. The high school building had a wide downstairs hallway; people milled around booths that had been installed along each side. Oh Jem. I forgot my money, I sighed, when I saw them. Atticus didnt, Jem said. Heres thirty cents, you can do six things. See you later on. Okay, I said, quite content with thirty cents and Cecil. I went with Cecil down to the front of the auditorium, through a door on one side, and backstage. I got rid of my ham costume and departed in a hurry, for Mrs. Merriweather was standing at a lectern in front of the first row of seats making last-minute, frenzied changes in the script. How much money you got? I asked Cecil. Cecil had thirty cents, too, which made us even. We squandered our first nickels on the House of Horrors, which scared us not at all; we entered the black seventh-grade room and were led around by the temporary ghoul in residence and were made to touch several objects alleged to be component parts of a human being. Heres his eyes, we were told when we touched two peeled grapes on a saucer. Heres his heart, which felt like raw liver. These are his innards, and our hands were thrust into a plate of coldspaghetti. Cecil and I visited several booths. We each bought a sack of Mrs. Judge Taylors homemade divinity. I wanted to bob for apples, but Cecil said it wasnt sanitary. His mother said he might catch something from everybodys heads having been in the same tub. Aint anything around town now to catch, I protested. But Cecil said his mother said it was unsanitary to eat after folks. I later asked Aunt Alexandra about this, and she said people who held such views were usuallyclimbers. We were about to purchase a blob of taffy when Mrs. Merriweathers runners appeared and told us to go backstage, it was time to get ready. The auditorium was filling with people; the Maycomb County High School band had assembled in front below the stage; the stage footlights were on and the red velvet curtain rippled and billowed from the scurrying going on behindit. Backstage, Cecil and I found the narrow hallway teeming with people: adults in homemade three-corner hats, Confederate caps, Spanish-American War hats, and World War helmets. Children dressed as various agricultural enterprises crowded around the one small window. Somebodys mashed my costume, I wailed in dismay. Mrs. Merriweather galloped to me, reshaped the chicken wire, and thrust me inside. You all right in there, Scout? asked Cecil. You sound so far off, like you was on the other side of a hill. You dont sound any nearer, I said. The band played the national anthem, and we heard the audience rise. Then the bass drum sounded. Mrs. Merriweather, stationed behind her lectern beside the band, said: Maycomb County Ad Astra Per Aspera. The bass drum boomed again. That means, said Mrs. Merriweather, translating for the rustic elements, from the mud to the stars. She added, unnecessarily, it seemed to me, A pageant. Reckon they wouldnt know what it was if she didnt tell em, whispered Cecil, who was immediately shushed. The whole town knows it, I breathed. But the country folksve come in, Cecil said. Be quiet back there, a mans voice ordered, and we were silent. The bass drum went boom with every sentence Mrs. Merriweather uttered. She chanted mournfully about Maycomb County being older than the state, that it was a part of the Mississippi and Alabama Territories, that the first white man to set foot in the virgin forests was the Probate Judges great-grandfather five times removed, who was never heard of again. Then came the fearless Colonel Maycomb, for whom the county was named. Andrew Jackson appointed him to a position of authority, and Colonel Maycombs misplaced self-confidence and slender sense of direction brought disaster to all who rode with him in the Creek Indian Wars. Colonel Maycomb persevered in his efforts to make the region safe for democracy, but his first campaign was his last. His orders, relayed to him by a friendly Indian runner, were to move south. After consulting a tree to ascertain from its lichen which way was south, and taking no lip from the subordinates who ventured to correct him, Colonel Maycomb set out on a purposeful journey to rout the enemy and entangled his troops so far northwest in the forest primeval that they were eventually rescued by settlers moving inland. Mrs. Merriweather gave a thirty-minute description of Colonel Maycombs exploits. I discovered that if I bent my knees I could tuck them under my costume and more or less sit. I sat down, listened to Mrs. Merriweathers drone and the bass drums boom and was soon fastasleep. They said later that Mrs. Merriweather was putting her all into the grand finale, that she had crooned, Po-ork, with a confidence born of pine trees and butterbeans entering on cue. She waited a few seconds, then called, Po-ork? When nothing materialized, she yelled, Pork! I must have heard her in my sleep, or the band playing Dixie woke me, but it was when Mrs. Merriweather triumphantly mounted the stage with the state flag that I chose to make my entrance. Chose is incorrect: I thought Id better catch up with the rest of them. They told me later that Judge Taylor went out behind the auditorium and stood there slapping his knees so hard Mrs. Taylor brought him a glass of water and one of his pills. Mrs. Merriweather seemed to have a hit, everybody was cheering so, but she caught me backstage and told me I had ruined her pageant. She made me feel awful, but when Jem came to fetch me he was sympathetic. He said he couldnt see my costume much from where he was sitting. How he could tell I was feeling bad under my costume I dont know, but he said I did all right, I just came in a little late, that was all. Jem was becoming almost as good as Atticus at making you feel right when things went wrong. Almostnot even Jem could make me go through that crowd, and he consented to wait backstage with me until the audience left. You wanta take it off, Scout? he asked. Naw, Ill just keep it on, I said. I could hide my mortification under it. You all want a ride home? someone asked. No sir, thank you, I heard Jem say. Its just a little walk. Be careful of haints, the voice said. Better still, tell the haints to be careful of Scout. There arent many folks left now, Jem told me. Lets go. We went through the auditorium to the hallway, then down the steps. It was still black dark. The remaining cars were parked on the other side of the building, and their headlights were little help. If some of em were goin in our direction we could see better, said Jem. Here Scout, let me hold onto yourhock. You might lose your balance. I can see all right. Yeah, but you might lose your balance. I felt a slight pressure on my head, and assumed that Jem had grabbed that end of the ham. You got me? Uh huh. We began crossing the black schoolyard, straining to see our feet. Jem, I said, I forgot my shoes, theyre back behind the stage. Well lets go get em. But as we turned around the auditorium lights went off. You can get em tomorrow, he said. But tomorrows Sunday, I protested, as Jem turned me homeward. You can get the Janitor to let you in Scout? Hm? Nothing. Jem hadnt started that in a long time. I wondered what he was thinking. Hed tell me when he wanted to, probably when we got home. I felt his fingers press the top of my costume, too hard, it seemed. I shook my head. Jem, you dont hafta Hush a minute, Scout, he said, pinching me. We walked along silently. Minutes up, I said. Whatcha thinkin about? I turned to look at him, but his outline was barely visible. Thought I heard something, he said. Stop a minute. We stopped. Hear anything? he asked. No. We had not gone five paces before he made me stop again. Jem, are you tryin to scare me? You know Im too old Be quiet, he said, and I knew he was not joking. The night was still. I could hear his breath coming easily beside me. Occasionally there was a sudden breeze that hit my bare legs, but it was all that remained of a promised windy night. This was the stillness before a thunderstorm. We listened. Heard an old dog just then, I said. Its not that, Jem answered. I hear it when were walkin along, but when we stop I dont hear it. You hear my costume rustlin. Aw, its just Halloween got you I said it more to convince myself than Jem, for sure enough, as we began walking, I heard what he was talking about. It was not my costume. Its just old Cecil, said Jem presently. He wont get us again. Lets dont let him think were hurrying. We slowed to a crawl. I asked Jem how Cecil could follow us in this dark, looked to me like hed bump into us from behind. I can see you, Scout, Jem said. How? I cant see you. Your fat streaks are showin. Mrs. Crenshaw painted em with some of that shiny stuff so theyd show up under the footlights. I can see you pretty well, an I expect Cecil can see you well enough to keep his distance. I would show Cecil that we knew he was behind us and we were ready for him. Cecil Jacobs is a big wet he-en! I yelled suddenly, turning around. We stopped. There was no acknowledgement save he-en bouncing off the distant schoolhouse wall. Ill get him, said Jem. He-y! Hay-e-hay-e-hay-ey, answered the schoolhouse wall. It was unlike Cecil to hold out for so long; once he pulled a joke hed repeat it time and again. We should have been leapt at already. Jem signaled for me to stop again. He said softly, Scout, can you take that thing off? I think so, but I aint got anything on under itmuch. Ive got your dresshere. I cant get it on in the dark. Okay, he said, never mind. Jem, are you afraid? No.Thinkwerealmosttothetreenow.Fewyardsfromthat,anwellbetotheroad. We can see the street light then. Jem was talking in an unhurried, flat toneless voice. I wondered how long he would try to keep the Cecil mythgoing. You reckon we oughta sing, Jem? No. Be real quiet again, Scout. We had not increased our pace. Jem knew as well as I that it was difficult to walk fast without stumping a toe, tripping on stones, and other inconveniences, and I was barefooted. Maybe it was the wind rustling the trees. But there wasnt any wind and there werent any trees except the big oak. Our company shuffled and dragged his feet, as if wearing heavy shoes. Whoever it was wore thick cotton pants; what I thought were trees rustling was the soft swish of cotton on cotton, wheek, wheek, with every step. I felt the sand go cold under my feet and I knew we were near the big oak. Jem pressed my head. We stopped and listened. Shuffle-foot had not stopped with us this time. His trousers swished softly and steadily. Then they stopped. He was running, running toward us with no childs steps. Run, Scout! Run! Run! Jem screamed. I took one giant step and found myself reeling: my arms useless, in the dark, I could not keep my balance. Jem, Jem, help me, Jem! Something crushed the chicken wire around me. Metal ripped on metal and I fell to the ground and rolled as far as I could, floundering to escape my wire prison. From somewhere near by came scuffling, kicking sounds, sounds of shoes and flesh scraping dirt and roots. Someone rolled against me and I felt Jem. He was up like lightning and pulling me with him but, though my head and shoulders were free, I was so entangled we didnt get very far. We were nearly to the road when I felt Jems hand leave me, felt him jerk backwards to the ground. More scuffling, and there came a dull crunching sound and Jem screamed. I ran in the direction of Jems scream and sank into a flabby male stomach. Its owner said, Uff! and tried to catch my arms, but they were tightly pinioned. His stomach was soft but his arms were like steel. He slowly squeezed the breath out of me. I could not move. Suddenly he was jerked backwards and flung on the ground, almost carrying me with him. I thought, Jems up. Ones mind works very slowly at times. Stunned, I stood there dumbly. The scuffling noises were dying; someone wheezed and the night was still again. Still but for a man breathing heavily, br
athing heavily and staggering. I thought he went to the tree and leaned against it. He coughed violently, a sobbing, bone-shaking cough. Jem? There was no answer but the mans heavybreathing. Jem? Jem didnt answer. The man began moving around, as if searching for something. I heard him groan and pull something heavy along the ground. It was slowly coming to me that there were now four people under the tree. Atticus? The man was walking heavily and unsteadily toward the road. I went to where I thought he had been and felt frantically along the ground, reaching out with my toes. Presently I touched someone. Jem? My toes touched trousers, a belt buckle, buttons, something I could not identify, a collar, and a face. A prickly stubble on the face told me it was not Jems. I smelled stale whiskey. I made my way along in what I thought was the direction of the road. I was not sure, because I had been turned around so many times. But I found it and looked down to the street light. A man was passing under it. The man was walking with the staccato steps of someone carrying a load too heavy for him. He was going around the corner. He was carrying Jem. Jems arm was dangling crazily in front of him. By the time I reached the corner the man was crossing our front yard. Light from our front door framed Atticus for an instant; he ran down the steps, and together, he and the man took Jem inside. I was at the front door when they were going down the hall. Aunt Alexandra was running to meet me. Call Dr. Reynolds! Atticuss voice came sharply from Jems room. Wheres Scout? Here she is, Aunt Alexandra called, pulling me along with her to the telephone. She tugged at me anxiously. Im all right, Aunty, I said, you better call. She pulled the receiver from the hook and said, Eula May, get Dr. Reynolds, quick! Agnes, is your father home? Oh God, where is he? Please tell him to come over here as soon as he comes in. Please, its urgent! There was no need for Aunt Alexandra to identify herself, people in Maycomb knew each others voices. Atticus came out of Jems room. The moment Aunt Alexandra broke the connection, Atticus took the receiver from her. He rattled the hook, then said, Eula May, get me the sheriff, please. Heck? Atticus Finch. Someones been after my children. Jems hurt. Between here and the schoolhouse. I cant leave my boy. Run out there for me, please, and see if hes still around. Doubt if youll find him now, but Id like to see him if you do. Got to go now. Thanks, Heck. Atticus, is Jem dead? No, Scout. Look after her, sister, he called, as he went down the hall. Aunt Alexandras fingers trembled as she unwound the crushed fabric and wire from around me. Are you all right, darling? she asked over and over as she worked me free. It was a relief to be out. My arms were beginning to tingle, and they were red with small hexagonal marks. I rubbed them, and they felt better. Aunty, is Jem dead? Nono, darling, hes unconscious. We wont know how badly hes hurt until Dr. Reynolds gets here. Jean Louise, what happened? I dont know. She left it at that. She brought me something to put on, and had I thought about it then, I would have never let her forget it: in her distraction, Aunty brought me my overalls.Puttheseon,darling,shesaid,handingmethegarmentsshemostdespised. She rushed back to Jems room, then came to me in the hall. She patted me vaguely, and went back to Jems room. A car stopped in front of the house. I knew Dr. Reynoldss step almost as well as my fathers. He had brought Jem and me into the world, had led us through every childhood disease known to man including the time Jem fell out of the treehouse, and he had never lost our friendship. Dr. Reynolds said if we had been boil-prone things would have been different, but we doubted it. He came in the door and said, Good Lord. He walked toward me, said, Youre still standing, and changed his course. He knew every room in the house. He also knew that if I was in bad shape, so was Jem. After ten forevers Dr. Reynolds returned. Is Jem dead? I asked. Far from it, he said, squatting down to me. Hes got a bump on the head just like yours, and a broken arm. Scout, look that wayno, dont turn your head, roll your eyes. Now look over yonder. Hes got a bad break, so far as I can tell now its in the elbow. Like somebody tried to wring his arm off Now look at me. Then hes not dead? No-o! Dr. Reynolds got to his feet. We cant do much tonight, he said, except try to make him as comfortable as we can. Well have to X-ray his armlooks like hell be wearing his arm way out by his side for a while. Dont worry, though, hell be as good as new. Boys his age bounce. While he was talking, Dr. Reynolds had been looking keenly at me, lightly fingering the bump that was coming on my forehead. You dont feel broke anywhere, do you? Dr. Reynoldss small joke made me smile. Then you dont think hes dead, then? He put on his hat. Now I may be wrong, of course, but I think hes very alive. Shows all the symptoms of it. Go have a look at him, and when I come back well get together and decide. Dr. Reynoldss step was young and brisk. Mr. Heck Tates was not. His heavy boots punished the porch and he opened the door awkwardly, but he said the same thing Dr. Reynolds said when he came in. You all right, Scout? he added. Yes sir, Im goin in to see Jem. Atticusnthems in there. Ill go with you, said Mr. Tate. Aunt Alexandra had shaded Jems reading light with a towel, and his room was dim. Jem was lying on his back. There was an ugly mark along one side of his face. His left arm lay out from his body; his elbow was bent slightly, but in the wrong direction. Jem was frowning. Jem? Atticus spoke. He cant hear you, Scout, hes out like a light. He was coming around, but Dr. Reynolds put him out again. Yes sir. I retreated. Jems room was large and square. Aunt Alexandra was sitting in a rocking-chair by the fireplace. The man who brought Jem in was standing in a corner, leaning against the wall. He was some countryman I did not know. He had probably been at the pageant, and was in the vicinity when it happened. He must have heard our screams and come running. Atticus was standing by Jems bed. Mr. Heck Tate stood in the doorway. His hat was in his hand, and a flashlight bulged from his pants pocket. He was in his working clothes. Come in, Heck, said Atticus. Did you find anything? I cant conceive of anyone low- down enough to do a thing like this, but I hope you found him. Mr. Tate sniffed. He glanced sharply at the man in the corner, nodded to him, then looked around the roomat Jem, at Aunt Alexandra, then at Atticus. Sit down, Mr. Finch, he said pleasantly. Atticus said, Lets all sit down. Have that chair, Heck. Ill get another one from the livingroom. Mr. Tate sat in Jems desk chair. He waited until Atticus returned and settled himself. I wondered why Atticus had not brought a chair for the man in the corner, but Atticus knew the ways of country people far better than I. Some of his rural clients would park their long-eared steeds under the chinaberry trees in the back yard, and Atticus would often keep appointments on the back steps. This one was probably more comfortable where he was. Mr. Finch, said Mr. Tate, tell you what I found. I found a little girls dressits out there in my car. That your dress, Scout? Yes sir, if its a pink one with smockin, I said. Mr. Tate was behaving as if he were on the witness stand. He liked to tell things his own way, untrammeled by state or defense, and sometimes it took him a while. I found some funny-looking pieces of muddy-colored cloth Thats mcostume, Mr. Tate. Mr. Tate ran his hands down his thighs. He rubbed his left arm and investigated Jems mantelpiece, then he seemed to be interested in the fireplace. His fingers sought his long nose. What is it, Heck? said Atticus. Mr. Tate found his neck and rubbed it. Bob Ewells lyin on the ground under that tree down yonder with a kitchen knife stuck up under his ribs. Hes dead, Mr. Finch.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch28,"It's a really dark night, but Scout has fun playing the various games the school put on before the pageant. The entire county is there to watch the show, and Scout invariably falls asleep waiting for her part in the play and makes her entrance much too late. She's mortified, but it makes everyone laugh. Because she's so embarrassed about her performance she asks Jem to wait until most of the people have left the school before they begin walking home. As they start their journey back home in the pitch black dark, Jem begins to hear someone following them. At first they think it's their friend, Cecil, trying to scare them, but they begin to realize that it's not. Before they know what's hit them they're attacked from whomever is following them. Scout is crushed under her costume, and then Jem screams. She can't see a thing, and then things grow quiet and she realizes there are now 4 people under the tree. Scout stumbles out into the road, calling for Jem, and then sees a man walking unsteadily, carrying Jem in front of him towards their house. When she gets inside Atticus quickly calls the doctor and the Sheriff, and none of them know how badly Jem is hurt until Dr. Reynolds gets there and informs them that he's got a broken arm. Heck Tate gets there next and tells them all that Bob Ewell is lying under the tree where they were attacked, dead with a kitchen knife stuck in his ribs."
"Aunt Alexandra got up and reached for the mantelpiece. Mr. Tate rose, but she declined assistance. For once in his life, Atticuss instinctive courtesy failed him: he sat where he was. Somehow, I could think of nothing but Mr. Bob Ewell saying hed get Atticus if it took him the rest of his life. Mr. Ewell almost got him, and it was the last thing he did. Are you sure? Atticus said bleakly. Hes dead all right, said Mr. Tate. Hes good and dead. He wont hurt these children again. I didnt mean that. Atticus seemed to be talking in his sleep. His age was beginning to show, his one sign of inner turmoil, the strong line of his jaw melted a little, one became aware of telltale creases forming under his ears, one noticed not his jet-black hair but the gray patches growing at his temples. Hadnt we better go to the livingroom? Aunt Alexandra said at last. If you dont mind, said Mr. Tate, Id rather us stay in here if it wont hurt Jem any. I want to have a look at his injuries while Scout tells us about it. Is it all right if I leave? she asked. Im just one person too many in here. Ill be in my room if you want me, Atticus. Aunt Alexandra went to the door, but she stopped and turned. Atticus, I had a feeling about this tonightIthis is my fault, she began. I shouldhave Mr. Tate held up his hand. You go ahead, Miss Alexandra, I know its been a shock to you. And dont you fret yourself about anythingwhy, if we followed our feelings all the time wed be like cats chasin their tails. Miss Scout, see if you can tell us what happened, while its still fresh in your mind. You think you can? Did you see him followingyou? I went to Atticus and felt his arms go around me. I buried my head in his lap. We started home. I said Jem, Ive forgot mshoes. Soons we started back for em the lights went out. Jem said I could get em tomorrow Scout, raise up so Mr. Tate can hear you, Atticus said. I crawled into his lap. Then Jem said hush a minute. I thought he was thinkinhe always wants you to hush so he can thinkthen he said he heard somethin. We thought it was Cecil. Cecil? Cecil Jacobs. He scared us once tonight, an we thought it was him again. He had on a sheet. They gave a quarter for the best costume, I dont know who won it Where were you when you thought it was Cecil? Just a little piece from the schoolhouse. I yelled somethin at him You yelled, what? Cecil Jacobs is a big fat hen, I think. We didnt hear nothinthen Jem yelled hello or somethin loud enough to wake the dead Just a minute, Scout, said Mr. Tate. Mr. Finch, did you hear them? Atticus said he didnt. He had the radio on. Aunt Alexandra had hers going in her bedroom. He remembered because she told him to turn his down a bit so she could hear hers. Atticus smiled. I always play a radio too loud. I wonder if the neighbors heard anything said Mr. Tate. I doubt it, Heck. Most of them listen to their radios or go to bed with the chickens. Maudie Atkinson may have been up, but I doubt it. Go ahead, Scout, Mr. Tate said. Well, after Jem yelled we walked on. Mr. Tate, I was shut up in my costume but I could hear it myself, then. Footsteps, I mean. They walked when we walked and stopped when we stopped. Jem said he could see me because Mrs. Crenshaw put some kind of shiny paint on my costume. I was a ham. Hows that? asked Mr. Tate, startled. Atticus described my role to Mr. Tate, plus the construction of my garment. You should have seen her when she came in, he said, it was crushed to a pulp. Mr. Tate rubbed his chin. I wondered why he had those marks on him, His sleeves were perforated with little holes. There were one or two little puncture marks on his arms to match the holes. Let me see that thing if you will, sir. Atticus fetched the remains of my costume. Mr. Tate turned it over and bent it around to get an idea of its former shape. This thing probably saved her life, he said. Look. He pointed with a long forefinger. A shiny clean line stood out on the dull wire. Bob Ewell meant business, Mr. Tate muttered. He was out of his mind, said Atticus. Dont like to contradict you, Mr. Finchwasnt crazy, mean as hell. Low-down skunk with enough liquor in him to make him brave enough to kill children. Hed never have met you face to face. Atticus shook his head. I cant conceive of a man whod Mr. Finch, theres just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say hidy to em. Even then, they aint worth the bullet it takes to shoot em. Ewell as one of em. Atticus said, I thought he got it all out of him the day he threatened me. Even if he hadnt, I thought hed come after me. He had guts enough to pester a poor colored woman, he had guts enough to pester Judge Taylor when he thought the house was empty, so do you think heda met you to your face in daylight? Mr. Tate sighed. Wed better get on. Scout, you heard him behind you Yes sir. When we got under the tree Howd you know you were under the tree, you couldnt see thunder out there. I was barefooted, and Jem says the grounds always cooler under a tree. Well have to make him a deputy, go ahead. Then all of a sudden somethin grabbed me an mashed my costume think I ducked on the ground heard a tusslin under the tree sort of they were bammin against the trunk, sounded like. Jem found me and started pullin me toward the road. SomeMr. Ewell yanked him down, I reckon. They tussled some more and then there was this funny noiseJem hollered I stopped. That was Jems arm. Anyway, Jem hollered and I didnt hear him any more an the next thingMr. Ewell was tryin to squeeze me to death, I reckon then somebody yanked Mr. Ewell down. Jem must have got up, I guess. Thats all I know And then? Mr. Tate was looking at me sharply. Somebody was staggerin around and pantin andcoughing fit to die. I thought it was Jem at first, but it didnt sound like him, so I went lookin for Jem on the ground. I thought Atticus had come to help us and had got wore out Who was it? Why there he is, Mr. Tate, he can tell you his name. As I said it, I half pointed to the man in the corner, but brought my arm down quickly lest Atticus reprimand me for pointing. It was impolite to point. He was still leaning against the wall. He had been leaning against the wall when I came into the room, his arms folded across his chest. As I pointed he brought his arms down and pressed the palms of his hands against the wall. They were white hands, sickly white hands that had never seen the sun, so white they stood out garishly against the dull cream wall in the dim light of Jems room. I looked from his hands to his sand-stained khaki pants; my eyes traveled up his thin frame to his torn denim shirt. His face was as white as his hands, but for a shadow on his jutting chin. His cheeks were thin to hollowness; his mouth was wide; there were shallow, almost delicate indentations at his temples, and his gray eyes were so colorless I thought he was blind. His hair was dead and thin, almost feathery on top of hishead. When I pointed to him his palms slipped slightly, leaving greasy sweat streaks on the wall, and he hooked his thumbs in his belt. A strange small spasm shook him, as if he heard fingernails scrape slate, but as I gazed at him in wonder the tension slowly drained from his face. His lips parted into a timid smile, and our neighbors image blurred with my sudden tears. Hey, Boo, I said.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch29,"Scout tells them all what happened leading up to the attack. The man that carried Jem into the house is still in the room with them, but he's so silent and in the shadows that they pretty much forget he's there. Heck Tate tells them that Scout's costume probably saved her life, as there is a slash mark through the chicken wire where Bob Ewell tried to stab her. When she gets to the end of her story she realizes that the man who saved their lives, the man who carried Jem home, is Boo Radley."
"Mr. Arthur, honey, said Atticus, gently correcting me. Jean Louise, this is Mr. Arthur Radley. I believe he already knows you. If Atticus could blandly introduce me to Boo Radley at a time like this, wellthat was Atticus. Boo saw me run instinctively to the bed where Jem was sleeping, for the same shy smile crept across his face. Hot with embarrassment, I tried to cover up by covering Jem up. Ah-ah, dont touch him, Atticus said. Mr. Heck Tate sat looking intently at Boo through his horn-rimmed glasses. He was about to speak when Dr. Reynolds came down the hall. Everybody out, he said, as he came in the door. Evenin, Arthur, didnt notice you the first time I was here. Dr. Reynoldss voice was as breezy as his step, as though he had said it every evening of his life, an announcement that astounded me even more than being in the same room with Boo Radley. Of course even Boo Radley got sick sometimes, I thought. But on the other hand I wasnt sure. Dr. Reynolds was carrying a big package wrapped in newspaper. He put it down on Jems desk and took off his coat. Youre quite satisfied hes alive, now? Tell you how I knew. When I tried to examine him he kicked me. Had to put him out good and proper to touch him. So scat, he said to me. Er said Atticus, glancing at Boo. Heck, lets go out on the front porch. There are plenty of chairs out there, and its still warm enough. I wondered why Atticus was inviting us to the front porch instead of the livingroom, then I understood. The livingroom lights were awfully strong. We filed out, first Mr. TateAtticus was waiting at the door for him to go ahead of him. Then he changed his mind and followed Mr.Tate. People have a habit of doing everyday things even under the oddest conditions. I was no exception: Come along, Mr. Arthur, I heard myself saying, you dont know the house real well. Ill just take you to the porch,sir. He looked down at me and nodded. I led him through the hall and past the livingroom. Wont you have a seat, Mr. Arthur? This rocking-chairs nice and comfortable. My small fantasy about him was alive again: he would be sitting on the porch right pretty spell were having, isnt it, Mr. Arthur? Yes, a right pretty spell. Feeling slightly unreal, I led him to the chair farthest from Atticus and Mr. Tate. It was in deep shadow. Boo would feel more comfortable in the dark. Atticus was sitting in the swing, and Mr. Tate was in a chair next to him. The light from the livingroom windows was strong on them. I sat beside Boo. Well, Heck, Atticus was saying, I guess the thing to dogood Lord, Im losing my memory Atticus pushed up his glasses and pressed his fingers to his eyes. Jems not quite thirteen no, hes already thirteenI cant remember. Anyway, itll come before county court What will, Mr. Finch? Mr. Tate uncrossed his legs and leaned forward. Of course it was clear-cut self defense, but Ill have to go to the office and hunt up Mr. Finch, do you think Jem killed Bob Ewell? Do you think that? You heard what Scout said, theres no doubt about it. She said Jem got up and yanked him off herhe probably got hold of Ewells knife somehow in the dark well find out tomorrow. Mis-ter Finch, hold on, said Mr. Tate. Jem never stabbed Bob Ewell. Atticus was silent for a moment. He looked at Mr. Tate as if he appreciated what he said. But Atticus shook his head. Heck, its mighty kind of you and I know youre doing it from that good heart of yours, but dont start anything like that. Mr. Tate got up and went to the edge of the porch. He spat into the shrubbery, then thrust his hands into his hip pockets and faced Atticus. Like what? he said. Im sorry if I spoke sharply, Heck, Atticus said simply, but nobodys hushing this up. I dont live that way. Nobodys gonna hush anything up, Mr. Finch. Mr. Tates voice was quiet, but his boots were planted so solidly on the porch floorboards it seemed that they grew there. A curious contest, the nature of which eluded me, was developing between my father and the sheriff. It was Atticuss turn to get up and go to the edge of the porch. He said, Hrm, and spat dryly into the yard. He put his hands in his pockets and faced Mr. Tate. Heck, you havent said it, but I know what youre thinking. Thank you for it. Jean Louise he turned to me. You said Jem yanked Mr. Ewell off you? Yes sir, thats what I thought I See there, Heck? Thank you from the bottom of my heart, but I dont want my boy starting out with something like this over his head. Best way to clear the air is to have it all out in the open. Let the county come and bring sandwiches. I dont want him growing up with a whisper about him, I dont want anybody saying, Jem Finch his daddy paid a mint to get him out of that. Sooner we get this over with the better. Mr. Finch, Mr. Tate said stolidly, Bob Ewell fell on his knife. He killed himself. Atticus walked to the corner of the porch. He looked at the wisteria vine. In his own way, I thought, each was as stubborn as the other. I wondered who would give in first. Atticuss stubbornness was quiet and rarely evident, but in some ways he was as set as the Cunninghams. Mr. Tates was unschooled and blunt, but it was equal to my fathers. Heck, Atticuss back was turned. If this things hushed up itll be a simple denial to Jem of the way Ive tried to raise him. Sometimes I think Im a total failure as a parent, but Im all theyve got. Before Jem looks at anyone else he looks at me, and Ive tried to live so I can look squarely back at him if I connived at something like this, frankly I couldnt meet his eye, and the day I cant do that Ill know Ive lost him. I dont want to lose him and Scout, because theyre all Ive got. Mr. Finch. Mr. Tate was still planted to the floorboards. Bob Ewell fell on his knife. I can prove it. Atticus wheeled around. His hands dug into his pockets. Heck, cant you even try to see it my way? Youve got children of your own, but Im older than you. When mine are grown Ill be an old man if Im still around, but right now Imif they dont trust me they wont trust anybody. Jem and Scout know what happened. If they hear of me saying downtown something different happenedHeck, I wont have them any more. I cant live one way in town and another way in my home. Mr. Tate rocked on his heels and said patiently, Hed flung Jem down, he stumbled over a root under that tree andlook, I can show you. Mr. Tate reached in his side pocket and withdrew a long switchblade knife. As he did so, Dr. Reynolds came to the door. The sondeceaseds under that tree, doctor, just inside the schoolyard. Got a flashlight? Better have this one. I can ease around and turn my car lights on, said Dr. Reynolds, but he took Mr. Tates flashlight. Jems all right. He wont wake up tonight, I hope, so dont worry. That the knife that killed him, Heck? No sir, still in him. Looked like a kitchen knife from the handle. Ken oughta be there with the hearse by now, doctor, night. Mr. Tate flicked open the knife. It was like this, he said. He held the knife and pretended to stumble; as he leaned forward his left arm went down in front of him. See there? Stabbed himself through that soft stuff between his ribs. His whole weight drove it in. Mr. Tate closed the knife and jammed it back in his pocket. Scout is eight years old, he said. She was too scared to know exactly what went on. Youd be surprised, Atticus said grimly. Im not sayin she made it up, Im sayin she was too scared to know exactly what happened. It was mighty dark out there, black as ink. d take somebody mighty used to the dark to make a competent witness I wont have it, Atticus said softly. God damn it, Im not thinking of Jem! Mr. Tates boot hit the floorboards so hard the lights in Miss Maudies bedroom went on. Miss Stephanie Crawfords lights went on. Atticus and Mr. Tate looked across the street, then at each other. They waited. When Mr. Tate spoke again his voice was barely audible. Mr. Finch, I hate to fight you when youre like this. Youve been under a strain tonight no man should ever have to go through. Why you aint in the bed from it I dont know, but I do know that for once you havent been able to put two and two together, and weve got to settle this tonight because tomorrowll be too late. Bob Ewells got a kitchen knife in his craw. Mr. Tate added that Atticus wasnt going to stand there and maintain that any boy Jems size with a busted arm had fight enough left in him to tackle and kill a grown man in the pitch dark. Heck, said Atticus abruptly, that was a switchblade you were waving. Whered you get it? Took it off a drunk man, Mr. Tate answered coolly. I was trying to remember. Mr. Ewell was on me then he went down Jem must have gotten up. At least I thought Heck? I said I took it off a drunk man downtown tonight. Ewell probably found that kitchen knife in the dump somewhere. Honed it down and bided his time just bided his time. Atticus made his way to the swing and sat down. His hands dangled limply between his knees. He was looking at the floor. He had moved with the same slowness that night in front of the jail, when I thought it took him forever to fold his newspaper and toss it in his chair. Mr. Tate clumped softly around the porch. It aint your decision, Mr. Finch, its all mine. Its my decision and my responsibility. For once, if you dont see it my way, theres not much you can do about it. If you wanta try, Ill call you a liar to your face. Your boy never stabbed Bob Ewell, he said slowly, didnt come near a mile of it and now you know it. All he wanted to do was get him and his sister safely home. Mr. Tate stopped pacing. He stopped in front of Atticus, and his back was to us. Im not a very good man, sir, but I am sheriff of Maycomb County. Lived in this town all my life an Im goin on forty-three years old. Know everything thats happened here since before I was born. Theres a black boy dead for no reason, and the man responsible for its dead. Let the dead bury the dead this time, Mr. Finch. Let the dead bury the dead. Mr. Tate went to the swing and picked up his hat. It was lying beside Atticus. Mr. Tate pushed back his hair and put his hat on. I never heard tell that its against the law for a citizen to do his utmost to prevent a crime from being committed, which is exactly what he did, but maybe youll say its my duty to tell the town all about it and not hush it up. Know whatd happen then? All the ladies in Maycomb includin my wifed be knocking on his door bringing angel food cakes. To my way of thinkin, Mr. Finch, taking the one man whos done you and this town a great service an draggin him with his shy ways into the limelightto me, thats a sin. Its a sin and Im not about to have it on my head. If it was any other man, itd be different. But not this man, Mr. Finch. Mr. Tate was trying to dig a hole in the floor with the toe of his boot. He pulled his nose, then he massaged his left arm. I may not be much, Mr. Finch, but Im still sheriff of Maycomb County and Bob Ewell fell on his knife. Good night, sir. Mr. Tate stamped off the porch and strode across the front yard. His car door slammed and he drove away. Atticus sat looking at the floor for a long time. Finally he raised his head. Scout, he said, Mr. Ewell fell on his knife. Can you possibly understand? Atticus looked like he needed cheering up. I ran to him and hugged him and kissed him with all my might. Yes sir, I understand, I reassured him. Mr. Tate was right. Atticus disengaged himself and looked at me. What do you mean? Well, itd be sort of like shootin a mockingbird, wouldnt it? Atticus put his face in my hair and rubbed it. When he got up and walked across the porch into the shadows, his youthful step had returned. Before he went inside the house, he stopped in front of Boo Radley. Thank you for my children, Arthur, he said.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch30,"As Dr. Reynolds starts to set Jem's arm they all head to the front porch, where Boo will be more comfortable in the shadows. Scout leads him out and sits beside him in the deepest shadow. Atticus and Heck Tate get into a battle of wills over who really killed Bob Ewell. Atticus believes Jem did it, and refuses to have the affair ""hushed up"" so it's hanging over Jem's head and the county has ample material for gossip. Heck Tate contends that Bob Ewell fell on his knife, and flat out refuses to tell anyone that Boo Radley killed him (which is what really happened). His reason is because he knows all the ladies of Maycomb county would be by Boo's house bringing him cakes to thank him, and he knows Boo doesn't want to be dragged into the limelight. Finally, Atticus agrees to the story, and thanks Boo for saving his children."
"When Boo Radley shuffled to his feet, light from the livingroom windows glistened on his forehead. Every move he made was uncertain, as if he were not sure his hands and feet could make proper contact with the things he touched. He coughed his dreadful raling cough, and was so shaken he had to sit down again. His hand searched for his hip pocket, and he pulled out a handkerchief. He coughed into it, then he wiped his forehead. Having been so accustomed to his absence, I found it incredible that he had been sitting beside me all this time, present. He had not made a sound. Once more, he got to his feet. He turned to me and nodded toward the front door. Youd like to say good night to Jem, wouldnt you, Mr. Arthur? Come right in. I led him down the hall. Aunt Alexandra was sitting by Jems bed. Come in, Arthur, she said. Hes still asleep. Dr. Reynolds gave him a heavy sedative. Jean Louise, is your father in the livingroom? Yes maam, I think so. Ill just go speak to him a minute. Dr. Reynolds left some her voice trailed away. Boo had drifted to a corner of the room, where he stood with his chin up, peering from a distance at Jem. I took him by the hand, a hand surprisingly warm for its whiteness. I tugged him a little, and he allowed me to lead him to Jems bed. Dr. Reynolds had made a tent-like arrangement over Jems arm, to keep the cover off, I guess, and Boo leaned forward and looked over it. An expression of timid curiosity was on his face, as though he had never seen a boy before. His mouth was slightly open, and he looked at Jem from head to foot. Boos hand came up, but he let it drop to his side. You can pet him, Mr. Arthur, hes asleep. You couldnt if he was awake, though, he wouldnt let you I found myself explaining. Go ahead. Boos hand hovered over Jems head. Go on, sir, hes asleep. His hand came down lightly on Jems hair. I was beginning to learn his body English. His hand tightened on mine and he indicated that he wanted to leave. I led him to the front porch, where his uneasy steps halted. He was still holding my hand and he gave no sign of letting me go. Will you take me home? He almost whispered it, in the voice of a child afraid of the dark. I put my foot on the top step and stopped. I would lead him through our house, but I would never lead him home. Mr. Arthur, bend your arm down here, like that. Thats right, sir. I slipped my hand into the crook of his arm. He had to stoop a little to accommodate me, but if Miss Stephanie Crawford was watching from her upstairs window, she would see Arthur Radley escorting me down the sidewalk, as any gentleman would do. We came to the street light on the corner, and I wondered how many times Dill had stood there hugging the fat pole, watching, waiting, hoping. I wondered how many times Jem and I had made this journey, but I entered the Radley front gate for the second time in my life. Boo and I walked up the steps to the porch. His fingers found the front doorknob. He gently released my hand, opened the door, went inside, and shut the door behind him. I never saw him again. Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between. Boo was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a pair of good-luck pennies, and our lives. But neighbors give in return. We never put back into the tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and it made me sad. I turned to go home. Street lights winked down the street all the way to town. I had never seen our neighborhood from this angle. There were Miss Maudies, Miss Stephaniesthere was our house, I could see the porch swingMiss Rachels house was beyond us, plainly visible. I could even see Mrs. Duboses. I looked behind me. To the left of the brown door was a long shuttered window. I walked to it, stood in front of it, and turned around. In daylight, I thought, you could see to the postoffice corner. Daylight in my mind, the night faded. It was daytime and the neighborhood was busy. Miss Stephanie Crawford crossed the street to tell the latest to Miss Rachel. Miss Maudie bent over her azaleas. It was summertime, and two children scampered down the sidewalk toward a man approaching in the distance. The man waved, and the children raced each other to him. It was still summertime, and the children came closer. A boy trudged down the sidewalk dragging a fishingpole behind him. A man stood waiting with his hands on his hips. Summertime, and his children played in the front yard with their friend, enacting a strange little drama of their own invention. It was fall, and his children fought on the sidewalk in front of Mrs. Duboses. The boy helped his sister to her feet, and they made their way home. Fall, and his children trotted to and fro around the corner, the days woes and triumphs on their faces. They stopped at an oak tree, delighted, puzzled, apprehensive. Winter, and his children shivered at the front gate, silhouetted against a blazing house. Winter, and a man walked into the street, dropped his glasses, and shot a dog. Summer, and he watched his childrens heart break. Autumn again, and Boos children needed him. Atticus was right. One time he said you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them. Just standing on the Radley porch was enough. The street lights were fuzzy from the fine rain that was falling. As I made my way home, I felt very old, but when I looked at the tip of my nose I could see fine misty beads, but looking cross-eyed made me dizzy so I quit. As I made my way home, I thought what a thing to tell Jem tomorrow. Hed be so mad he missed it he wouldnt speak to me for days. As I made my way home, I thought Jem and I would get grown but there wasnt much else left for us to learn, except possibly algebra. I ran up the steps and into the house. Aunt Alexandra had gone to bed, and Atticuss room was dark. I would see if Jem might be reviving. Atticus was in Jems room, sitting by his bed. He was reading a book. Is Jem awake yet? Sleeping peacefully. He wont be awake until morning. Oh. Are you sittin up with him? Just for an hour or so. Go to bed, Scout. Youve had a long day. Well, I think Ill stay with you for a while. Suit yourself, said Atticus. It must have been after midnight, and I was puzzled by his amiable acquiescence. He was shrewder than I, however: the moment I sat down I began to feel sleepy. Whatcha readin? I asked. Atticus turned the book over. Something of Jems. CalledThe Gray Ghost. I was suddenly awake. Whyd you get that one? Honey, I dont know. Just picked it up. One of the few things I havent read, he said pointedly. Read it out loud, please, Atticus. Its real scary. No, he said. Youve had enough scaring for a while. This is too Atticus, I wasnt scared. He raised his eyebrows, and I protested: Leastways not till I started telling Mr. Tate about it. Jem wasnt scared. Asked him and he said he wasnt. Besides, nothins real scary except in books. Atticus opened his mouth to say something, but shut it again. He took his thumb from the middle of the book and turned back to the first page. I moved over and leaned my head against his knee. Hrm, he said. The Gray Ghost, by Seckatary Hawkins. Chapter One I willed myself to stay awake, but the rain was so soft and the room was so warm and his voice was so deep and his knee was so snug that I slept. Seconds later, it seemed, his shoe was gently nudging my ribs. He lifted me to my feet and walked me to my room. Heard every word you said, I muttered. wasnt sleep at all, s about a ship an Three-Fingered Fred n Stoners Boy He unhooked my overalls, leaned me against him, and pulled them off. He held me up with one hand and reached for my pajamas with the other. Yeah, an they all thought it was Stoners Boy messin up their clubhouse an throwin ink all over it an He guided me to the bed and sat me down. He lifted my legs and put me under the cover. An they chased him n never could catch him cause they didnt know what he looked like, an Atticus, when they finally saw him, why he hadnt done any of those things Atticus, he was real nice His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me. Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them. He turned out the light and went into Jems room. He would be there all night, and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning.",To Kill a Mockingbird  Ch31,"Scout leads Boo back into the house one last time so he can say goodbye to Jem, who is still sleeping, and then she walks him home. After he goes inside she stands on his front porch and realizes that she can see the entire neighborhood. She understands that all through the years Boo has watched them grow up, playing games and living their lives. She begins to understand that maybe she and Jem did give something to Boo after all. She gives him a hug and heads back home."
